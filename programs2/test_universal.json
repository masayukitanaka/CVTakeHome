What might surprise you is that, many times, they result in claims and\njudgments in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which ultimately impact your insurance premium. In most instances, these claims can\nbe lessened or prevented entirely simply by addressing the most common causes of such losses listed below.\nMost Common Causes\nu(cid:3) Spills, wet or icy walking surfaces\nu(cid:3) Uneven or worn floors/carpets/steps/sidewalks\nu(cid:3) Inadequate or poorly maintained lighting\nu(cid:3) Obstructed views\nu(cid:3) Poor housekeeping - Excess clutter/trash in walkways or near open flames or hot surfaces\nWe encourage you to please take the time to periodically inspect your premises to see if any of these conditions exist and work to\neliminate them where possible. Your efforts may save you money on future insurance premiums and, quite possibly, save your business.\nThank you for choosing and trusting us to help protect your business!\n“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”\n-Benjamin Franklin\nRegards,\nThomas P.
