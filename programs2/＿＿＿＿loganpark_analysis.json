What might surprise you is that, many times, they result in claims and\njudgments in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which ultimately impact your insurance premium. In most instances, these claims can\nbe lessened or prevented entirely simply by addressing the most common causes of such losses listed below.\nMost Common Causes\nu(cid:3) Spills, wet or icy walking surfaces\nu(cid:3) Uneven or worn floors/carpets/steps/sidewalks\nu(cid:3) Inadequate or poorly maintained lighting\nu(cid:3) Obstructed views\nu(cid:3) Poor housekeeping - Excess clutter/trash in walkways or near open flames or hot surfaces\nWe encourage you to please take the time to periodically inspect your premises to see if any of these conditions exist and work to\neliminate them where possible. Your efforts may save you money on future insurance premiums and, quite possibly, save your business.\nThank you for choosing and trusting us to help protect your business!\n“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”\n-Benjamin Franklin\nRegards,\nThomas P.

As defined in Section, 102\n(1) of the Act: The term “act of terrorism” means any act or acts that are certified by the Secretary of the\nTreasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General of the United\nStates, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or\ninfrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case\nof certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed\nby an individual or individuals, as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to\ninfluence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.\nYou should know that any coverage for losses caused by certified acts of terrorism is partially reimbursed\nby the United States under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula, the United States\nreimburses 80% of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the\ninsurance company providing the coverage. The premium charged for this coverage is provided below and\ndoes not include any charges for the portion of loss covered by the federal government under the Act.\nCoverage for \"insured losses”, as defined in the Act, is subject to the coverage terms, conditions, amounts\nand limits in this policy applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism.\nYou should know that the Act, as amended, contains a $100 billion cap that limits U.S. Government\nreimbursement, as well as insurers' liability, for losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism when the\namount of such losses in any one calendar year exceeds $100 billion. If the aggregate insured losses for\nall insurers exceed $100 billion in any one calendar year, your coverage may be reduced.\nYou should also know that, under federal law, you are not required to purchase coverage for losses caused\nby certified acts of terrorism.\nREJECTION OR SELECTION OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE\nNote: In the states of California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, North Carolina, Oregon,\nWashington, West Virginia and Wisconsin, our terrorism exclusion makes an exception for fire losses\nresulting from an Act of Terrorism. In these states, if you decline to purchase Terrorism Coverage, you still\nhave coverage for fire losses resulting from an Act of Terrorism.\nPlease “X” one of the boxes below and return this notice to the Company.\nI decline to purchase Terrorism Coverage. I understand that I will have no coverage for losses\narising from acts of Terrorism.\nI elect to purchase coverage for certified acts of Terrorism for a premium\nof $100 .\nOn File with the Company LOGAN PARK NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION\nApplicant Name (Print) Named Insured\nAuthorized Signature Date\nTRIADN RENEWAL (12-20) Page 1of 1",
