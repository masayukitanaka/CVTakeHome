# YOUR INSURANCE AUDIT - HOW TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY

## WHAT IS AN INSURANCE AUDIT?

Insurance audits are typically performed on commercial insurance policies providing auto, general liability, garage liability, umbrella, and workers compensation coverages. When these policies are issued, you are asked to pay an estimated premium. Estimated premiums are based on the nature of your business and your estimate of exposures (i.e., payroll, sales, etc.) for the policy period.

Once your policy expires, we conduct an audit to collect information on actual exposures and operations. From this information, we determine the final earned premium. Premium adjustments are then determined by comparing audited exposures and operations with the original policy estimates.

## WHAT RECORDS ARE NEEDED FOR THE AUDIT?

Good record keeping is important to the audit process. Accurate records provide and confirm information, save time, and minimize your insurance costs. The premium auditor will let you know which of the following records will be needed for your audit when the audit appointment is made.

- **PAYROLL RECORDS** include payroll journal and summary, federal tax reports (941's), state unemployment reports, and individual earnings records. Totals should be kept for overtime when applicable.
- **EMPLOYEE RECORDS** include the number of employees and hours, days, or weeks worked annually.
- **SALES JOURNAL** includes all goods or products sold, rented, and/or distributed as well as service, repair, and installation. Sales or excise taxes collected separately and submitted to the government need to be identified in order to be excluded.
- **CHECK REGISTER and CASH DISBURSEMENTS** show payments to subcontractors, material costs, and payments for casual labor.
- **CERTIFICATES OF INSURANCE** show the subcontractors used during the policy period for construction, erection, and/or repair for general liability and workers compensation insurance coverages. They are also used for commercial automobile hired auto coverage.
- **INCOME STATEMENTS** include subcontracted labor costs and payroll amounts.

## WHEN AND HOW WILL THE AUDIT BE DONE?

We will collect audit information from you shortly after your policy expires. Smaller, less complex policies may only require that you assemble and send the necessary information to us, or have the information available when a telephone auditor calls.

Larger and more complicated policies are handled by a field auditor, who will schedule an appointment with you shortly after the policy expires.

If you must change or cancel a scheduled appointment, please contact the auditor as far in advance as you can. It is best to schedule and complete this audit within 30 days from your policy expiration date. It is important for the auditor to ask questions about your operations. If you cannot be present to answer questions, someone familiar with the specifics of your entire business operations should be available. If you direct us to your accountant, we will obtain as much information as possible from your accountant and contact you with additional questions.

Most of our audits take a half hour or less, but audits of larger policies may take longer. Though the auditor will have a number of questions, you will not have to be directly involved during the entire audit if adequate records are available.

## HOW CAN YOU SAVE MONEY?

There are several ways you can save on premium dollars depending on the type of business and coverages you have. Not all of the following may apply to your particular business.

Agency Code 06-0883-00 Policy Number 234606-08269279
```

## PAYROLL DIVISION

A single employee's payroll can be divided, except when the employee works in a clerical, sales, drafting or driving position. Proper records must be kept in dollar amounts that reflect work actually performed before a breakdown can be applied. Without adequate records, the entire payroll for the employee must be placed in the highest rated classification.

## EMPLOYEE TIPS

Tips declared by employees may be excluded from their gross payroll only if separately identified. Amounts added to customer's bills, such as service charges, which are collected by you and disbursed to your employees are not excludable.

## CERTIFICATES OF INSURANCE

Have certificates available for the audit at your premises (or your accountant's) to ensure that charges are not made unnecessarily. It is best to obtain a certificate of insurance prior to a subcontractor performing work for you. Certificates must cover the period when the subcontractor worked for you. This may require certificates covering two different policy terms for the subcontractor.

## DRIVERS

(For general liability coverage), employees with the sole responsibility of driving may often be excluded from chargeable payroll, if their wages are shown separately. However, employees who perform other duties besides driving must be placed in the highest rated class describing their duties.

## COST OF HIRE

Cost of hire is commonly used on commercial automobile policies as a premium basis for hired auto coverage. This includes automobiles and trailers used under contract on behalf of or loaned to the named insured, which may include rental units as well as subcontracted hauling for the insured.

Your business is unique. If you have questions about how your specific circumstances will affect savings, please contact your insurance agent.

## BASIC DEFINITIONS

**REMUNERATION** is commonly called payroll, but can include items not normally part of payroll, or exclude items which are part of payroll. It includes wages, the value of meals and lodging, and other substitutes for money. (Substitutes for money include draws, dividends, traveling expenses and travel time payments, gift certificates or merchandise credits, annuities, and contributions to individual retirement accounts. This list is not all inclusive but represents common substitutes for money). Your premium auditor will discuss this with you at the time of your audit.

**OVERTIME** is the hours worked for which there is an increase in the rate of pay. It includes:

1. Work in excess of 8 hours per day, or 40 hours per week.
2. Work on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays.
3. Work in any day or week, in excess of a guaranteed wage agreement.
4. Ordinarily, overtime pay is equal to 1 1/2 times the regular hourly rate. For example, a regular pay rate of $10 per hour at time and a half generates a $15 per hour overtime rate. If the extra $5 of pay is shown separately, it is excluded in total. If total overtime wage is shown in a combined amount of $15 (regular pay plus increase) and included in gross payroll, one third ($5) will be deducted from gross pay. If the overtime wage is calculated at double time, one half will be deducted from gross pay.
5. Extra pay for shift differential is not considered overtime.

**GROSS SALES** is the gross amount charged by you or others trading under your name for all goods or products sold or distributed, operations performed and rentals. Some deductions from gross sales include sales or excise tax, returns and allowances and finance charges for items sold on installment.

**SUBCONTRACTOR** is often used interchangeably with "independent contractor". We ordinarily apply the definition to subcontractors performing construction, erection or structural alteration for a general contractor. Most workers compensation laws hold you responsible for employees of an uninsured subcontractor. In some states, they may extend to an uninsured subcontractor without employees, if an employee-employer relationship can be established. A liability policy will also include a charge for subcontractors as though they were your employees if there is no certificate showing evidence of insurance. Subcontractors can easily obtain a certificate of insurance through their insurance agent.

**TOTAL COST** is the cost of all work let or sublet in connection with each specific project including:

1. The cost of all labor, materials and equipment furnished, used, or delivered for use in the execution of the work.

2. All fees, bonuses or commissions made, paid or due.  
3. The rates apply per $1,000 of total cost.

## COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why is an audit necessary?**  
A: To calculate the exact amount of premium you will be charged. Actual exposures and operations are determined by an audit. After they are compared with initial estimates and later endorsements, a final audit premium is determined.

**Q: If overtime is not summarized, will I still get credit?**  
A: Overtime records must show overtime pay separately by employee or classification or it will not be deducted.

**Q: If I do not have certificates of insurance from subcontractors for the audit, will I be able to get them?**  
A: It is in your best interest to request a certificate from a subcontractor prior to the work being performed, rather than at the time of audit. You will be charged for employees of those subcontractors not providing certificates as though they were your employees.

**Q: Several of my employees do more than one type of work. How should I assign their payrolls?**  
A: Payrolls may be divided into appropriate classifications, provided the division is reflected on the original records in dollar amounts.

**Q: Some of my work could be considered clerical and sales. Should I separate it?**  
A: The clerical and sales classifications cannot be used with any other class for division of a single employee's payroll.

**Q: Is it necessary to provide audit information if my renewal policy has been canceled?**  
A: Yes, policies are issued using estimated payroll or sales. Actual payroll or sales needs to be known to determine if additional premium is due the company, or a return premium is due the policyholder. In some states, a surcharge/penalty may be applied to the policy for failure to comply with the audit process.

# NOTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE CHANGES IN COVERAGE FOR TERRORISM

Dear Policyholder:

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) will expire on December 31, 2027 unless the Federal government extends the Act. What this means to you is the following:

1. Subject to policy terms and conditions, the enclosed policy will provide insurance coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined in the Act only until December 31, 2027.

2. A conditional endorsement entitled, **Conditional Exclusion Of Terrorism Involving Nuclear, Biological Or Chemical Terrorism (Relating To Disposition Of Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act)** is enclosed. This conditional endorsement will only apply if the Act is not extended or if the Act is revised to increase statutory deductibles, decrease the federal government's share in potential losses above the statutory deductibles, change the levels, terms or conditions of coverage and we are no longer required to make terrorism coverage available and elect not to do so. It will not apply if the Act is simply extended.

3. The conditional endorsement will provide coverage for an incident of terrorism pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy only if the incident does not involve nuclear, biological or chemical material.

4. A premium charge for the conditional endorsement will be applied effective January 1, 2028. The premium will be prorated for the remainder of the policy term and is one-half of the current premium charge appearing in the Declarations for **TERRORISM - CERTIFIED ACTS**. However, it will only be made if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) is not extended. Revised Declarations will be mailed to you after January 1, 2028.

5. If the Act is extended without any revision, the enclosed policy will continue to provide coverage for certified acts of terrorism. The conditional endorsement will not be activated and the changes in coverage or premium referenced above will not apply.

6. If the Act is extended with revisions or is replaced, and we are required or elect to continue to offer coverage for certified acts of terrorism, we may amend this policy in accordance with the provisions of the revised Act or its replacement.

This notice is for informational purposes only.

If you have any questions concerning your policy or this notice, please contact your Auto-Owners agency.

# OWNERS INSURANCE COMPANY

## NOTICE CONCERNING POLICYHOLDER RIGHTS IN AN INSOLVENCY UNDER THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION LAW

The financial strength of your insurer is one of the most important things for you to consider when determining from whom to purchase a property or liability insurance policy. It is your best assurance that you will receive the protection for which you purchased the policy. If your insurer becomes insolvent, you may have protection from the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association as described below but to the extent that your policy is not protected by the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association or if it exceeds the guaranty association's limits, you will only have the assets, if any, of the insolvent insurer to satisfy your claim.

Residents of Minnesota who purchase property and casualty or liability insurance from insurance companies licensed to do business in Minnesota are protected, **SUBJECT TO LIMITS AND EXCLUSIONS**, in the event the insurer becomes insolvent. This protection is provided by the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association.

### Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association

7600 Parklawn Avenue  
Edina, Minnesota 55435-5137  
(952) 831-1908

The maximum amount that the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association will pay in regard to a claim under all policies issued by the same insurer is limited to $300,000. This limit does not apply to workers' compensation insurance. Protection by the guaranty association is subject to other substantial limitations and exclusions. If your claim exceeds the guaranty association's limits, you may still recover a part or all of that amount from the proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvent insurer, if any exist. Funds to pay claims may not be immediately available. The guaranty association assesses insurers licensed to sell property and casualty or liability insurance in Minnesota after the insolvency occurs. Claims are paid from the assessment.

**THE PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR USING CARE IN SELECTING INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE WELL MANAGED AND FINANCIALLY STABLE. IN SELECTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY OR POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON PROTECTION BY THE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION.**

**THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED BY MINNESOTA STATE LAW TO ADVISE POLICYHOLDERS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES OF THEIR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT THEIR INSURANCE CARRIER BECOMES INSOLVENT. THIS NOTICE IN NO WAY IMPLIES THAT THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. ALL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THIS NOTICE.**

**Agency Code** `06-0883-00`  
**Policy Number** `234606-08269279`

In the endorsement. If no applicable Deductible is shown in the Schedule for a coverage, the policy Deductible shown in the Declarations will apply to such coverage unless otherwise stated.

In any one occurrence of loss or damage (hereinafter referred to as loss), the Deductible will apply as follows:

1. Multiple Deductibles may apply to a loss. However, if multiple types of Covered Property are involved in a loss and different Deductibles are shown in the Schedule for the different types of Covered Property, only the largest applicable Deductible for each coverage will apply. When a Deductible in the Schedule applies to a Business Income or Extra Expense loss, such Deductible applies in place of any waiting period set forth in the BUSINESS INCOME form attached to this policy.

2. If the adjusted amount of loss is less than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for that loss. If the adjusted amount of loss exceeds the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deductible from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

3. The Schedule may indicate Direct Coverages Deductibles and Indirect Coverages Deductibles. Unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule, Indirect Coverages Deductibles apply to Business Income loss and Extra Expense loss and Direct Coverages Deductibles apply to all other loss.

4. When a Dollar Deductible is shown in the Schedule, we will subtract the Deductible amount from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

5. When a Time Deductible is shown in the Schedule, we will not pay for loss that occurs during the specified time period immediately following the "Equipment Breakdown" occurrence. If the Time Deductible is expressed as a number of days, each day means twenty-four consecutive hours.

6. When a Multiple of ADV Deductible is shown in the Schedule, the amount of the Deductible will be calculated as follows:

   a. Take the amount of Business Income that you would have earned during the "period of restoration" had no "Equipment Breakdown" loss occurred (Business Income and "period of restoration" have the meanings set forth in the BUSINESS INCOME form attached to this policy). The Business Income will include the entire location regardless of the loss affecting the entire location or part of the location. If two or more locations are affected in the "Equipment Breakdown" loss, the Business Income will be the combined amount of all affected locations.

   b. Take the result in paragraph 6.a. and divide it by the number of days your business would have been operating during the "period of restoration" had no "Equipment Breakdown" occurred. This result is the Average Daily Value.

   c. The Average Daily Value calculated in paragraph 6.b. multiplied by the number shown in the Schedule is the amount of the Multiple of ADV Deductible. We will subtract this amount from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

**F. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS** is amended. The following Conditions are added for purposes of this endorsement only.

1. **Suspension**

   Whenever Covered Property is found to be in, or exposed to, a dangerous condition, any of our representatives may immediately suspend the insurance against loss to that Covered Property for the perils covered by this endorsement. Coverage can be suspended and possibly reinstated by delivering or mailing a written notice of suspension or coverage reinstatement to:

### (5) Other Insurance Issued By Us

If this policy provides coverage for Data Processing Equipment Coverages, Electronic Data Processing Equipment, Refrigerated Products, Spoilage or Mechanical Breakdown where two or more of this policy's coverages apply to the same loss or damage, the coverage of this endorsement shall supersede any coverages provided outside of this Equipment Breakdown Endorsement for the loss or damage that arises out of an "Equipment Breakdown" loss.

## Debris Removal Expense

The debris removal expense is less than 25% of the sum of the loss payable plus the deductible. The sum of the loss payable and the debris removal expense ($49,500 + $10,000 = $59,500) is less than the Limit of Insurance. Therefore, the full amount of debris removal expense is payable in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (3).

### EXAMPLE #1

- **Limit of Insurance:** $90,000
- **Amount of Deductible:** $500
- **Amount of Loss:** $50,000
- **Amount of Loss Payable:** $49,500 ($50,000 - $500)
- **Debris Removal Expense:** $10,000
- **Debris Removal Expense Payable:** $10,000 ($10,000 is 20% of $50,000.)

### EXAMPLE #2

- **Limit of Insurance:** $90,000
- **Amount of Deductible:** $500
- **Amount of Loss:** $80,000
- **Amount of Loss Payable:** $79,500 ($80,000 - $500)
- **Debris Removal Expense:** $30,000

#### Debris Removal Expense Payable

| Description       | Amount   |
|-------------------|----------|
| Basic Amount      | $10,500  |
| Additional Amount | $10,000  |

The basic amount payable for debris removal expense under the terms of Paragraph (3) is calculated as follows: $80,000 ($79,500 + $500) x .25 = $20,000; capped at $10,500. The cap applies because the sum of the loss payable ($79,500) and the basic amount payable for debris removal expense ($10,500) cannot exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000).

The additional amount payable for debris removal expense is provided in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (4), because the debris removal expense ($30,000) exceeds 25% of the loss payable plus the deductible ($30,000 is 37.5% of $80,000), and because the sum of the loss payable and debris removal expense ($79,500 + $30,000 = $109,500) would exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000). The additional amount of covered debris removal expense is $10,000, the maximum payable under Paragraph (4). Thus, the total payable for debris removal expense in this example is $20,500; $9,500 of the debris removal expense is not covered.

## Preservation Of Property

If it is necessary to move Covered Property from the described premises to preserve it from loss or damage by a Covered Cause of Loss, we will pay for any direct physical loss or damage to that property:

1. While it is being moved or while temporarily stored at another location; and
2. Only if the loss or damage occurs within 45 days, unless a higher number of days are shown in the Declarations, after the property is first moved.

This Additional Coverage does not apply to costs to test for, monitor or assess the existence, concentration or effects of "pollutants". However, we will pay for testing which is performed in the course of extracting the "pollutants" from the land or water.

c. Electronic Data;

      2. 25%, if no percentage is shown in the Declarations for Your Business Personal Property - Seasonal Increase to provide for seasonal variances.

      1. The 12 months immediately preceding the date loss or damage occurs; or
      2. The period of time you have been in business as of the date the loss or damage occurs.

### D. DEDUCTIBLE

The applicable Deductible shown in the Declarations will apply unless otherwise stated by endorsement.

In any one occurrence of loss or damage (hereinafter referred to as loss), the Deductible will apply as follows:

1. We will first reduce the amount of loss if required by the Coinsurance Condition or the Agreed Value Optional Coverage.
   
   a. If the adjusted amount of loss is less than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for that loss.
   
   b. If the adjusted amount of loss exceeds the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deductible from the adjusted amount of loss and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

2. If Paragraph 1., above does not apply:
   
   a. If the amount of loss is less than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for that loss.
   
   b. If the amount of loss exceeds the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deductible from the loss and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

When the occurrence involves loss to more than one item of Covered Property and separate Limits of Insurance apply, the losses will not be combined in determining application of the Deductible. However, the Deductible will be applied only once per occurrence.

3. No Deductible applies to the following Additional Coverages:
   
   a. Fire Department Service Charge;  
   b. Fire Extinguisher Systems Recharge Expense;  
   c. Arson Reward;  
   d. Theft Reward; and  
   e. Rekeying of Locks.

In the following examples, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance.

The following examples assume there is no Coinsurance penalty.

#### EXAMPLE #1

- **Deductible:** $250  
- **Limit of Insurance - Building #1:** $60,000  
- **Limit of Insurance - Building #2:** $80,000  
- **Loss to Building #1:** $60,100  
- **Loss to Building #2:** $90,000  

The amount of loss to Building #1 ($60,100) is less than the sum ($60,250) of the Limit of Insurance applicable to Building #1 plus the Deductible.

The Deductible will be subtracted from the amount of loss in calculating the loss payable for Building #1:

```
$60,100
- 250
$59,850 Loss Payable - Building #1
```

The Deductible applies once per occurrence and therefore is not subtracted in determining the amount of loss payable for Building #2. Loss payable for Building #2 is the Limit of Insurance of $80,000.

  (Exceeds Limit of Insurance plus Deductible)
- **Loss to Building #2:** $90,000  
  (Exceeds Limit of Insurance plus Deductible)
- **Loss Payable – Building #1:** $60,000  
  (Limit of Insurance)

  (Limit of Insurance)

**Total amount of loss payable:** $140,000

If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.
   5. At our request, give us complete inventories of the damaged and undamaged property. Include quantities, costs, values and amount of loss claimed.

h. A party wall is a wall that separates and is common to adjoining buildings that are owned by different parties. In settling covered losses involving a party wall, we will pay a proportion of the loss to the party wall based on your interest in the wall in proportion to the interest of the owner of the adjoining building. However, if you elect to repair or replace your building and the owner of the adjoining building elects not to repair or replace that building, we will pay you the full value of the loss to the party wall, subject to all applicable policy provisions including Limits of Insurance, the Valuation and Coinsurance Conditions and all other provisions of this Loss Payment Condition. Our payment under the provisions of this paragraph does not alter any right of subrogation we may have against any entity.

If either you or we recover any property after loss settlement, that party must give the other prompt notice.

- If you recover the property, at your option, you may retain the property.

1. **Buildings under construction or renovation** are not considered vacant.

2. **Vacancy Provisions**  
   If the building where loss or damage occurs has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days before that loss or damage occurs:

   1. We will not pay for any loss or damage caused by any of the following even if they are Covered Causes of Loss:
      - Vandalism;
      - Sprinkler leakage, unless you have protected the system against freezing;
      - Building glass breakage;
      - Water damage;
      - Theft; or
      - Attempted theft.

   2. With respect to Covered Causes of Loss other than those listed in b.(1)(a) through b.(1)(f) above, we will reduce the amount we would otherwise pay for the loss or damage by 15%.

### Valuation

We will determine the value of Covered Property in the event of loss or damage as follows:

a. At actual cash value as of the time of loss or damage, except as provided in b., c., d., and e. below.

b. If the Limit of Insurance for Building satisfies the Additional Condition, Coinsurance, and the cost to repair or replace the damaged building property is $2,500 or less, we will pay the cost of building repairs or replacement.

   - The cost of building repairs or replacement does not include the increased cost attributable to enforcement of any ordinance or law regulating the construction, use, or repair of any property.

   - However, the following property will be valued at the actual cash value even when attached to the building:
     1. Awnings or floor coverings;
     2. Appliances for refrigerating, ventilating, cooking, dishwashing, or laundering; or
     3. Outdoor equipment or furniture.

c. "Stock" you have sold but not delivered at the selling price less discounts and expenses you otherwise would have had.

d. Glass at the cost of replacement with safety-glazing material if required by law.

e. Tenants' Improvements and Betterments at:

   1. Actual cash value of the lost or damaged property if you make repairs promptly.
   2. A proportion of your original cost if you do not make repairs promptly. We will determine the proportionate value as follows:
      - Multiply the original cost by the number of days from the loss or damage to the expiration of the lease; and
      - Divide the amount determined in (a) above by the number of days from the installation of improvements to the expiration of the lease.

   - If your lease contains a renewal option, the expiration of the renewal option period will replace the expiration of the lease in the procedure.

   3. Nothing if others pay for repairs or replacement.

### Additional Conditions

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

1. **Coinsurance**  
   If a Coinsurance percentage is shown in the Declarations, the following condition applies:

   a. We will not pay the full amount of any loss if the value of Covered Property at the time of loss times the Coinsurance percentage shown for it in the Declarations is greater than the Limit of Insurance for the property.

   - Instead, we will determine the most we will pay using the following steps:
     1. Multiply the value of Covered Property at the time of loss by the Coinsurance percentage;
     2. Divide the Limit of Insurance of the property by the figure determined in Step (1);
     3. Multiply the total amount of loss, before the application of any deductible, by the figure determined in Step (2); and
     4. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in Step (3).

   - We will pay the amount determined in Step (4) or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less. For the remainder, you will either have to rely on other insurance or absorb the loss yourself.

**Agency Code** `06-0883-00` **Policy Number** `234606-08269279`

In the following examples, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance.

- **Building at Location #2:** $30,000
- **Personal Property at Location #2:** $20,000
- **Total:** $50,000

### EXAMPLE #1 (UNDERINSURANCE)

1. **Step (1):** $250,000 x 90% = $225,000  
   When:  
   - The value of the property is: $250,000  
   - The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 80%  
   - The Limit of Insurance for it is: $100,000  
   - The Deductible is: $250  
   - The amount of loss is: $40,000  

2. **Step (2):** $180,000 ÷ $225,000 = .80

3. **Step (3):** $50,000 x .80 = $40,000

4. **Step (4):** $40,000 - $1,000 = $39,000

   We will pay no more than $39,000. The remaining $11,000 is not covered.

5. **Step (1):** $250,000 x 80% = $200,000  
   (the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Co-insurance requirements)

6. **Step (2):** $100,000 ÷ $200,000 = .50

7. **Step (3):** $40,000 x .50 = $20,000

8. **Step (4):** $20,000 - $250 = $19,750

   We will pay no more than $19,750. The remaining $20,250 is not covered.

### 2. Mortgageholders

a. The term mortgageholder includes trustee.

b. We will pay for covered loss of or damage to buildings or structures to each mortgageholder shown in the Declarations in their order of precedence, as interests may appear.

c. The mortgageholder has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgageholder has started foreclosure or similar action on the building or structure.

d. If we deny your claim because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part, the mortgageholder will still have the right to receive loss payment if the mortgageholder:

   1. Pays any premium due under this Coverage Part at our request if you have failed to do so;
   2. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so; and
   3. Has notified us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk known to the mortgageholder.

   All of the terms of this Coverage Part will then apply directly to the mortgageholder.

e. If we pay the mortgageholder for any loss or damage and deny payment to you because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part:

   1. The mortgageholder's rights under the mortgage will be transferred to us to the extent of the amount we pay; and
   2. The mortgageholder's right to recover the full amount of the mortgageholder's claim will not be impaired.

   At our option, we may pay to the mortgageholder the whole principal on the mortgage.

### EXAMPLE #2 (ADEQUATE INSURANCE)

- **When:**
  - The value of the property is: $250,000
  - The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 80%
  - The Limit of Insurance for it is: $200,000
  - The Deductible is: $250
  - The amount of loss is: $40,000

The minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($250,000 x 80%). Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this example is adequate and no penalty applies. We will pay no more than $39,750 ($40,000 amount of loss minus the deductible of $250).

b. If one Limit of Insurance applies to two or more separate items, this condition will apply to the total of all property to which the limit applies.

### EXAMPLE #3

- **When:**
  - The value of the property is:
    - Building at Location #1: $75,000
    - Building at Location #2: $100,000
    - Personal Property at Location #2: $75,000
  - **Total:** $250,000

- **The Coinsurance percentage for it is:** 90%
- **The Limit of Insurance for Buildings and Personal Property at Locations #1 and #2 is:** $180,000
- **The Deductible is:** $1,000
- **The amount of loss is:**

Agency Code `06-0883-00`  
Policy Number `234606-08269279`

introduced into or enacted on a computer system (including "electronic data") or a network to which it is connected, designed to damage or destroy any part of the system or disrupt its normal operation. However, there is no coverage for an interruption related to manipulation of a computer system (including "electronic data") by any employee, including a temporary or leased employee, or by an entity retained by you or for you to inspect, design, install, maintain, repair or replace that system.

(3) The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations for all loss sustained and expense incurred in any one policy year, regardless of the number of interruptions or the number of premises, locations or computer systems involved is **$10,000**, unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations, subject to the following:

- (a) If at the time of interruption, the computer system is equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, this entire amount is available.
- (b) If at the time of interruption, the computer system is not equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, payment will be limited to **$2,500** for that occurrence.

If loss payment relating to the first interruption does not exhaust this amount, then the balance is available for loss or expense sustained or incurred as a result of subsequent interruptions in that policy year. A balance remaining at the end of a policy year does not increase the amount of insurance in the next policy year. With respect to any interruption which begins in one policy year and continues or results in additional loss or expense in a subsequent policy year(s), all loss and expense is deemed to be sustained or incurred in the policy year in which the interruption began.

(4) This Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations does not apply to loss sustained or expense incurred after the end of the "period of restoration", even if the amount of insurance stated in (3) above has not been exhausted.

   The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the amount of Net Income and operating expense or amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding.

   Each party will:
   
   a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and  
   b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

   If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

2. **Duties In The Event Of Loss**

   a. You must see that the following are done in the event of loss:

      1. Notify the police if a law may have been broken.
      2. Give us prompt notice of the direct physical loss or damage. Include a description of the property involved.
      3. As soon as possible, give us a description of how, when, and where the direct physical loss or damage occurred.
      4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for any subsequent loss or damage resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.
      5. As often as may be reasonably required, permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records. Also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection, testing and analysis, and permit us to make copies from your books and records.
      6. Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss containing the information we request to investigate the claim. You must do this within 60 days after our request. We will supply you with the necessary forms.
      7. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.
      8. If you intend to continue your business, you must resume all or part of your "operations" as quickly as possible.

   b. We may examine any insured under oath, while not in the presence of any other insured and at such times as may be reasonably required, about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim, including an insured's books and records. In the event of an examination, an insured's answers must be signed.

3. **Loss Determination**

   a. The amount of Business Income loss will be determined based on:

      1. The Net Income of the business before the direct physical loss or damage occurred;
      2. The likely Net Income of the business if no physical loss or damage had occurred, but not including any Net Income that would likely have been earned as a result of an increase in the volume of business due to favorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss on customers or on other businesses;
      3. The operating expenses, including payroll expenses, necessary to resume "operations" with the same quality of service that existed just before the direct physical loss or damage; and

### (4) Other Relevant Sources of Information

b. An appraisal award has been made.

#### D. ADDITIONAL CONDITION

**COINSURANCE**

If a Coinsurance percentage is shown in the Declarations, the following condition applies in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

b. The amount of Extra Expense will be determined based on:

1. All expenses that exceed the normal operating expenses that would have been incurred by "operations" during the "period of restoration" if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred. We will deduct from the total of such expenses:
   - (a) The salvage value that remains of any property bought for temporary use during the "period of restoration" once "operations" are resumed; and
   - (b) Any Extra Expense that is paid for by other insurance, except for insurance that is written subject to the same plan, terms, conditions and provisions as this insurance; and

2. Necessary expenses that reduce the Business Income loss that otherwise would have been incurred.

#### c. Resumption Of Operations

We will reduce the amount of your:

1. Business Income loss, other than Extra Expense, to the extent you can resume your "operations", in whole or in part, by using damaged or undamaged property (including merchandise or stock) at the described premises or elsewhere.
2. Extra Expense loss to the extent you can return "operations" to normal and discontinue such Extra Expense.

d. If you do not resume "operations", or do not resume "operations" as quickly as possible, we will pay based on the length of time it would have taken to resume "operations" as quickly as possible.

### 4. Loss Payment

### Cost Considerations

1. **Cost of raw stock and factory supplies consumed** (including transportation charges);
2. **Cost of merchandise sold** (including transportation charges);
3. **Cost of other supplies consumed** (including transportation charges);
4. **Cost of services purchased from outsiders** (not employees) to resell, that do not continue under contract;
5. **Power, heat and refrigeration expenses** that do not continue under contract (if `Form CP 15 11` is attached);
6. **All ordinary payroll expenses** or the amount of payroll expense excluded (if `Form CP 15 10` is attached); and
7. **Special deductions for mining properties** (royalties unless specifically included in coverage; actual depletion commonly known as unit or cost depletion - not percentage depletion; welfare and retirement fund charges based on tonnage; hired trucks).

Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this example is adequate and no penalty applies. We will pay no more than $80,000 (amount of loss).

This condition does not apply to Extra Expense Coverage.

### E. Optional Coverages

If shown as applicable in the Declarations, the following Optional Coverages apply separately to each item.

#### 1. Maximum Period Of Indemnity

a. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to this Coverage Form at the described premises to which this Optional Coverage applies.

b. The most we will pay for the total of Business Income loss and Extra Expense is the lesser of:

   1. The amount of loss sustained and expenses incurred during the 120 days immediately following the beginning of the "period of restoration"; or
   2. The Limit of Insurance shown in the Declarations.

#### 2. Monthly Limit Of Indemnity

a. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to this Coverage Form at the described premises to which this Optional Coverage applies.

b. The most we will pay for loss of Business Income in each period of 30 consecutive days after the beginning of the "period of restoration" is:

   1. The Limit of Insurance, multiplied by
   2. The fraction shown in the Declarations for this Optional Coverage.

In the following example, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance.

#### Example #1 (Underinsurance)

- **When:** The Net Income and operating expenses for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy at the described premises would have been: **$400,000**
- **The Coinsurance percentage is:** **50%**
- **The Limit of Insurance is:** **$150,000**
- **The amount of loss is:** **$80,000**

**Steps:**

1. $400,000 x 50% = $200,000 (the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirements)
2. $150,000 ÷ $200,000 = .75
3. $80,000 x .75 = $60,000

We will pay no more than $60,000. The remaining $20,000 is not covered.

#### Example #2 (Adequate Insurance)

- **When:** The Net Income and operating expenses for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy at the described premises would have been: **$400,000**
- **The Coinsurance percentage is:** **50%**
- **The Limit of Insurance is:** **$200,000**
- **The amount of loss is:** **$80,000**

The minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($400,000 x 50%).

### Coverage Details

#### Collapse Coverage

1. The coverage described in E.2. and E.6. only applies when the "fungi", wet rot or dry rot is the result of a "specified cause of loss" other than fire or lightning that occurs during the policy term and only if all reasonable means were used to save and preserve the property from further damage at the time of and after that occurrence.

2. We will pay for loss or damage by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot. As used in this Limited Coverage, the term loss or damage means:
   - a. Direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property caused by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot, including the cost of removal of the "fungi", wet rot or dry rot;
   - b. The cost to tear out and replace any part of the building or other property as needed to gain access to the "fungi", wet rot or dry rot; and
   - c. The cost of testing performed after removal, repair, replacement or restoration of the damaged property is completed, provided there is a reason to believe that "fungi", wet rot or dry rot are present.

3. The coverage described under E.2. of this Limited Coverage is limited to 10% of the building or personal property limit of insurance, whichever is greater, subject to a maximum of $100,000 and a minimum of $15,000. Regardless of the number of claims, this limit is the most we will pay for the total of all loss or damage arising out of all occurrences of "specified causes of loss" (other than fire or lightning) which take place in a 12-month period (starting with the beginning of the present annual policy term). With respect to a particular occurrence of loss which results in "fungi", wet rot or dry rot, we will not pay more than this limit even if the "fungi", wet rot or dry rot continues to be present or active, or recurs, in a later policy term.

4. The coverage provided under this Limited Coverage does not increase the applicable Limit of Insurance on any Covered Property. If a particular occurrence results in loss or damage by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot, and other loss or damage, we will not pay more, for the total of all loss or damage, than the applicable Limit of Insurance on the affected Covered Property.

5. If there is covered loss or damage to Covered Property, not caused by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot, loss payment will not be limited by the terms of this Limited Coverage, except to the extent that "fungi", wet rot or dry rot causes an increase in the loss. Any such increase in the loss will be subject to the terms of this Limited Coverage.

#### Property Specifics

- With respect to the following property:
  - a. Outdoor radio or television antennas (including satellite dishes) and their lead-in wiring, masts or towers;
  - b. Awnings, gutters and downspouts;
  - c. Yard fixtures;
  - d. Outdoor swimming pools;
  - e. Fences;
  - f. Piers, wharves and docks;
  - g. Beach or diving platforms or appurtenances;
  - h. Retaining walls; and
  - i. Walks, roadways and other paved surfaces

If an abrupt collapse is caused by a cause of loss listed in 2.a. through 2.d., we will pay for loss or damage to that property only if:
- (1) Such loss or damage is a direct result of the abrupt collapse of a building insured under this Coverage Form; and
- (2) The property is Covered Property under this Coverage Form.

5. If personal property abruptly falls down or caves in and such collapse is not the result of abrupt collapse of a building, we will pay for loss or damage to Covered Property caused by such collapse of personal property only if:
   - a. The collapse of personal property was caused by a cause of loss listed in 2.a. through 2.d.;
   - b. The personal property which collapses is inside a building; and
   - c. The property which collapses is not of a kind listed in 4., regardless of whether that kind of property is considered to be personal property or real property.

The coverage stated in this Paragraph 5. does not apply to personal property if marring and/or scratching is the only damage to that personal property caused by the collapse.

6. This Additional Coverage - Collapse does not apply to personal property that has not abruptly fallen down or caved in, even if the personal property shows evidence of cracking, bulging, sagging, bending, leaning, settling, shrinkage or expansion.

7. This Additional Coverage - Collapse will not increase the Limits of Insurance provided in this Coverage Part.

8. The term Covered Cause of Loss includes the Additional Coverage - Collapse as described and limited in D.1. through D.7.

5. The terms of this Limited Coverage do not increase or reduce the coverage provided under Paragraph F.2. (Water Damage, Other Liquids, Powder Or Molten Material Damage) of this Causes Of Loss Form or under the Additional Coverage - Collapse.

6. The following, 6.a. or 6.b., applies only if Business Income and/or Extra Expense Coverage applies to the described premises and only if the "suspension" of "operations" satisfies all terms and conditions of the applicable Business Income and/or Extra Expense Coverage Form.

   a. If the loss which resulted in "fungi", wet rot or dry rot does not in itself necessitate a "suspension" of "operations", but such "suspension" is necessary due to loss or damage to property caused by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot, then our payment under Business Income and/or Extra Expense is limited to the amount of loss and/or expense sustained in a period of not more than 45 days. The days need not be consecutive.

   b. If a covered "suspension" of "operations" was caused by loss or damage other than "fungi", wet rot or dry rot but remediation of "fungi", wet rot or dry rot prolongs the "period of restoration", we will pay for loss and/or expense sustained during the delay (regardless of when such a delay occurs during the "period of restoration"), however, such coverage is limited to 45 days. The days need not be consecutive.

   If loss or damage caused by or resulting from covered water or other liquid, powder or molten material occurs, we will also pay the cost to tear out and replace any part of the building or structure to repair damage to the system or appliance from which the water or other substance escapes.

The words "we", "us" and "our" refer to the company providing this insurance. The word "insured" means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II – Who Is An Insured. Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Section V – Definitions.

## SECTION I – COVERAGES

### COVERAGE A – BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY

1. **Insuring Agreement**

   a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any "suit" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any "suit" seeking damages for "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any "occurrence" and settle any claim or "suit" that may result. But:

      1. The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in Section III – Limits Of Insurance; and

      2. Our right and duty to defend ends when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements under Coverages A or B or medical expenses under Coverage C.

   No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided for under Supplementary Payments – Coverages A and B.

   b. This insurance applies to "bodily injury" and "property damage" only if:

      1. The "bodily injury" or "property damage" is caused by an "occurrence" that takes place in the "coverage territory";

      2. The "bodily injury" or "property damage" occurs during the policy period; and

      3. Prior to the policy period, no insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured and no "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim, knew that the "bodily injury" or "property damage" had occurred, in whole or in part. If such a listed insured or authorized "employee" knew, prior to the policy period, that the "bodily injury" or "property damage" occurred, then any continuation, change or resumption of such "bodily injury" or "property damage" during or after the policy period will be deemed to have been known prior to the policy period.

   c. "Bodily injury" or "property damage" which occurs during the policy period and was not, prior to the policy period, known to have occurred by any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured or any "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim, includes any continuation, change or resumption of that "bodily injury" or "property damage" after the end of the policy period.

   d. "Bodily injury" or "property damage" will be deemed to have been known to have occurred at the earliest time when any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured or any "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim:

      1. Reports all, or any part, of the "bodily injury" or "property damage" to us or any other insurer;

      2. Receives a written or verbal demand or claim for damages because of the "bodily injury" or "property damage"; or

An agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability signed by us, the insured and the claimant or the claimant's legal representative.

## 4. Other Insurance

If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under Coverages A or B of this Coverage Part, our obligations are limited as follows:

a. **Primary Insurance**

   This insurance is primary except when Paragraph b. below applies. If this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in Paragraph c. below.

      b. Any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations, or the products and completed operations, for which you have been added as an additional insured.

   2. When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the insured against any "suit" if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that "suit". If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the insured's rights against all those other insurers.

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE COVERAGE

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was signed into law on November 26, 2002. The Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) defines an act of terrorism, to mean any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States to be:

(i) an act of terrorism;  
(ii) to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure;  
(iii) to have resulted in damage within the United States or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and  
(iv) to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States government by coercion.

Subject to the policy terms and conditions, this policy provides insurance coverage for acts of terrorism as defined in the Act.

Any coverage for certain commercial lines of property and casualty insurance provided by your policy for losses caused by certified acts of terrorism are partially paid by the federal government under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula, the government will reimburse us for 85% of such covered losses that exceed the statutory deductible paid by us. However, beginning January 1, 2016, the share will decrease 1% per calendar year until it equals 80%. You should also know that in the event aggregate insured losses exceed $100 billion during any year the Act is in effect, then the federal government and participating United States insurers that have met their insurer deductible shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of that amount of the loss that exceeds $100 billion. In the event that aggregate insured losses exceed $100 billion annually, no additional claims will be paid by the federal government or insurers. This formula is currently effective through December 31, 2020 unless extended.

The premium charge, if any, for this coverage is shown separately on the attached Declarations page. In the event of a certified act of terrorism, future policies also may include a government assessed terrorism loss risk-spreading premium in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

Please contact us if you would like to reject coverage for certified acts of terrorism.
