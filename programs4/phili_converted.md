# U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL ("OFAC")

## ADVISORY NOTICE TO POLICYHOLDERS

No coverage is provided by this Policyholder Notice nor can it be construed to replace any provisions of your policy. You should read your policy and review your Declarations page for complete information on the coverages you are provided.

This Notice provides information concerning possible impact on your insurance coverage due to directives issued by OFAC. Please read this Notice carefully.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and enforces sanctions policy, based on Presidential declarations of "national emergency". OFAC has identified and listed numerous:

- Foreign agents;
- Front organizations;
- Terrorists;
- Terrorist organizations; and
- Narcotics traffickers;

as "Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons". This list can be located on the United States Treasury's web site – [http://www.treas.gov/ofac](http://www.treas.gov/ofac).

In accordance with OFAC regulations, if it is determined that you or any other insured, or any person or entity claiming the benefits of this insurance has violated U.S. sanctions law or is a Specially Designated National and Blocked Person, as identified by OFAC, this insurance will be considered a blocked or frozen contract and all provisions of this insurance are immediately subject to OFAC. When an insurance policy is considered to be such a blocked or frozen contract, no payments nor premium refunds may be made without authorization from OFAC. Other limitations on the premiums and payments also apply.

`PI-HS-029 (02/20)` – **EXCLUSION - ADOPTION AND FOSTER CARE OPERATIONS ENDORSEMENT**

---

This new exclusionary endorsement is applicable to all lines of business, including Umbrella. It is mandatory for any insured that is a Human Services or Religious Organization and that is engaged in any adoption or foster care services. `PI-HS-029` reduces coverage by providing that there is no coverage for any claim arising out of any adoption or foster care services provided by the insured, unless:

- The insured has disclosed such services in its application for coverage; and
- We have agreed to provide coverage for such services.

There is an additional stipulation that, even if coverage is available for an insured as a result of its disclosure of services in its application and our agreeing to provide coverage, under no circumstances is there coverage for any individual (or any entity formed by such individual) who is acting as a foster parent or who is providing temporary housing or supplemental care to a foster child, unless that individual is an “employee” of the insured who is acting within the scope of their employment by the insured.

The exclusion specifies that insurance does not apply to any loss, cost, expense, fine, penalty, act, error and omission, sum, or damage alleging, arising out of or from, attributable to, or giving rise to any injury sustained by any person or organization and which is:

- Caused by alleged, actual or threatened abuse or molestation by anyone;
- The result of any “professional incident”;
- The result of any “bodily injury,” “property damage” or “personal and advertising injury”;
- Otherwise assumed as a result of any transfer to a third party of a contract or agreement to provide adoption or foster care placement services; or
- The result of providing any referral(s) to any other organization.

If such claim results from the insured providing any “adoption or foster care services.”

We shall not have any duty to defend any “suit” against any insured on account of any such injury.

The endorsement provides a definition of “Adoption or foster care services”; which includes the also defined terms “Adoption case management” and “Foster care case management.”

## Schedule Of Hired Or Borrowed Covered Auto Coverage And Premiums

For "autos" used in your motor carrier operations, cost of hire means:

1. The total dollar amount of costs you incurred for the hire of automobiles (includes "trailers" and semitrailers) and, if not included therein,
2. The total remunerations of all operators and drivers' helpers, of hired automobiles, whether hired with a driver by lessor or an "employee" of the lessee, or any other third party, and
3. The total dollar amount of any other costs (e.g., repair, maintenance, fuel, etc.) directly associated with operating the hired automobiles, whether such costs are absorbed by the "insured", paid to the lessor or owner, or paid to others.

For "autos" NOT used in your motor carrier operations, cost of hire means the total amount you incur for the hire of "autos" you don't own (not including "autos" you borrow or rent from your partners or "employees" or their family members). Cost of hire does not include charges for services performed by motor carriers of property or passengers.

Policy Number: Named Insured:  
Terrorism Premium (Certified Acts) $______6.00_____________

# PHILADELPHIA INSURANCE COMPANIES

## DISCLOSURE NOTICE OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE REJECTION OPTION

You are hereby notified that under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended, you have a right to purchase insurance coverage for losses resulting from acts of terrorism. As defined in Section 102(1) of the Act: The term “act of terrorism” means any act or acts that are certified by the Secretary of the Treasury—in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General of the United States—to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.

**YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WHERE COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BY THIS POLICY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM, SUCH LOSSES MAY BE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT UNDER A FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL LAW. HOWEVER, YOUR POLICY MAY CONTAIN OTHER EXCLUSIONS WHICH MIGHT AFFECT YOUR COVERAGE, SUCH AS AN EXCLUSION FOR NUCLEAR EVENTS. UNDER THE FORMULA, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S FEDERAL SHARE OF TERRORISM LOSSES IS 80% OF COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES EXCEEDING THE STATUTORILY ESTABLISHED DEDUCTIBLE PAID BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY PROVIDING THE COVERAGE. THE PREMIUM CHARGED FOR THIS COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BELOW AND DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY CHARGES FOR THE PORTION OF LOSS THAT MAY BE COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ACT.**

**YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT, AS AMENDED, CONTAINS A $100 BILLION CAP THAT LIMITS U.S. GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS INSURERS’ LIABILITY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH LOSSES IN ANY ONE CALENDAR YEAR EXCEEDS $100 BILLION. IF THE AGGREGATE INSURED LOSSES FOR ALL INSURERS EXCEED $100 BILLION, YOUR COVERAGE MAY BE REDUCED.**

Your attached proposal (or policy) includes a charge for terrorism. We will issue (or have issued) your policy with terrorism coverage unless you decline by placing an “X” in the box below.

**NOTE 1:** If “included” is shown on your proposal (or policy) for terrorism you WILL NOT have the option to reject the coverage.

**NOTE 2:** You will want to check with entities that have an interest in your organization as they may require that you maintain terrorism coverage (e.g. mortgagees).

**EXCEPTION:** If you have property coverage on your policy, the following Standard Fire Policy states do not permit an Insured to reject fire ensuing from terrorism: CA, CT, GA, HI, IA, IL, MA, ME, MO, NJ, NY, NC, OR, RI, VA, WA, WV, WI. Therefore, if you are domiciled in the above states and reject terrorism coverage, you will still be charged for fire ensuing from terrorism as separately designated on your proposal.

`PI-TER-DN1 (1/21)`

I decline to purchase terrorism coverage. I understand that I will have no coverage for losses arising from “certified” acts of terrorism, **EXCEPT** as noted above.

You, as the Insured, have 30 days after receipt of this notice to consider the selection/rejection of “terrorism” coverage. After this 30 day period, any request for selection or rejection of terrorism coverage **WILL NOT** be honored.

## REQUIRED IN GA – LIMITATION ON PAYMENT OF TERRORISM LOSSES

(applies to policies which cover terrorism losses insured under the federal program, including those which only cover fire losses)

The provisions of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended, can limit our maximum liability for payment of losses from certified acts of terrorism. That determination will be based on a formula set forth in the law involving the national total of federally insured terrorism losses in an annual period and individual insurer participation in payment of such losses. If one or more certified acts of terrorism in an annual period causes the maximum liability for payment of losses from certified acts of terrorism to be reached, and we have satisfied our required level of payments under the law, then we will not pay for the portion of such losses above that maximum. However, that is subject to possible change at that time, as Congress may, under the Act, determine that payments above the cap will be made.

### 3. Covered Causes Of Loss

See applicable Causes Of Loss form as shown in the Declarations.

### 4. Additional Coverages

#### a. Debris Removal

1. Subject to Paragraphs (2), (3) and (4), we will pay your expense to remove debris of Covered Property and other debris that is on the described premises, when such debris is caused by or results from a Covered Cause of Loss that occurs during the policy period. The expenses will be paid only if they are reported to us in writing within 180 days of the date of direct physical loss or damage.

2. Debris Removal does not apply to costs to:  
   (a) Remove debris of property of yours that is not insured under this policy, or property in your possession that is not Covered Property;  
   (b) Remove debris of property owned by or leased to the landlord of the building where your described premises are located, unless you have a contractual responsibility to insure such property and it is insured under this policy;  
   (c) Remove any property that is Property Not Covered, including property addressed under the Outdoor Property Coverage Extension;  
   (d) Remove property of others of a type other than autos, you hold for sale; that would not be Covered Property under this Coverage Form;  
   (e) Remove deposits of mud or earth from the grounds of the described premises;  
   (f) Extract "pollutants" from land or water; or  
   (g) Remove, restore or replace polluted land or water.

3. Subject to the exceptions in Paragraph (4), the following provisions apply:  
   (a) The most we will pay for the total of direct physical loss or damage plus debris removal expense is the Limit of Insurance applicable to the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage.  
   (b) Subject to (a) above, the amount we will pay for debris removal expense is limited to 25% of the sum of the deductible plus the amount that we pay for direct physical loss or damage to the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage. However, if no Covered Property has sustained direct physical loss or damage, the most we will pay for removal of debris of other property (if such removal is covered under this Additional Coverage) is $5,000 at each location.

4. We will pay up to an additional $25,000 for debris removal expense, for each location, in any one occurrence of physical loss or damage to Covered Property, if one or both of the following circumstances apply:  
   (a) The total of the actual debris removal expense plus the amount we pay for direct physical loss or damage exceeds the Limit of Insurance on the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage.  
   (b) The actual debris removal expense exceeds 25% of the sum of the deductible plus the amount that we pay for direct physical loss or damage to the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage.

`CP 00 10 10 12 © Insurance Services Office, Inc., 2011 Page 3 of 16`
```

---

```markdown
Therefore, if (4)(a) and/or (4)(b) applies, the additional amount payable for debris removal expense is provided in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (4), because the debris removal expense may reach but will never exceed the Limit of Insurance on the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage, plus $25,000.

### (5) Examples

The following examples assume that there is no Coinsurance penalty.

#### Example 1

- **Limit of Insurance:** $90,000
- **Amount of Deductible:** $500
- **Amount of Loss:** $50,000
- **Amount of Loss Payable:** $49,500 ($50,000 – $500)
- **Debris Removal Expense:** $10,000
- **Debris Removal Expense Payable:** $10,000 ($10,000 is 20% of $50,000.)

The debris removal expense is less than 25% of the sum of the loss payable plus the deductible. The sum of the loss payable and the debris removal expense ($49,500 + $10,000 = $59,500) is less than the Limit of Insurance. Therefore, the full amount of debris removal expense is payable in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (3).

#### Example 2

- **Limit of Insurance:** $90,000
- **Amount of Deductible:** $500
- **Amount of Loss:** $80,000
- **Amount of Loss Payable:** $79,500 ($80,000 – $500)
- **Debris Removal Expense:** $40,000

**Debris Removal Expense Payable:**

- **Basic Amount:** $10,500
- **Additional Amount:** $25,000

The basic amount payable for debris removal expense under the terms of Paragraph (3) is calculated as follows: $80,000 ($79,500 + $500) x .25 = $20,000, capped at $10,500. The cap applies because the sum of the loss payable ($79,500) and the basic amount payable for debris removal expense ($10,500) cannot exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000).

b. **Preservation Of Property**

If it is necessary to move Covered Property from the described premises to preserve it from loss or damage by a Covered Cause of Loss, we will pay for any direct physical loss or damage to that property:

1. While it is being moved or while temporarily stored at another location; and
2. Only if the loss or damage occurs within 30 days after the property is first moved.

c. **Fire Department Service Charge**

When the fire department is called to save or protect Covered Property from a Covered Cause of Loss, we will pay up to $1,000 for service at each premises described in the Declarations, unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations. Such limit is the most we will pay regardless of the number of responding fire departments or fire units, and regardless of the number or type of services performed. This Additional Coverage applies to your liability for fire department service charges:

1. Assumed by contract or agreement prior to loss; or
2. Required by local ordinance.

No Deductible applies to this Additional Coverage.

### d. Pollutant Clean-up And Removal

(5) Under this Additional Coverage, we will not pay for:

We will pay your expense to extract "pollutants" from land or water at the described premises if the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of the "pollutants" is caused by or results from a Covered Cause of Loss that occurs during the policy period. The expenses will be paid only if they are reported to us in writing within 180 days of the date on which the Covered Cause of Loss occurs.

This Additional Coverage does not apply to costs to test for, monitor or assess the existence, concentration or effects of "pollutants". But we will pay for testing which is performed in the course of extracting the "pollutants" from the land or water.

The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage for each described premises is $10,000 for the sum of all covered expenses arising out of Covered Causes of Loss occurring during each separate 12-month period of this policy.

- (a) The enforcement of or compliance with any ordinance or law which requires demolition, repair, replacement, reconstruction, remodeling or remediation of property due to contamination by "pollutants" or due to the presence, growth, proliferation, spread or any activity of "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria; or
- (b) Any costs associated with the enforcement of or compliance with an ordinance or law which requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of "pollutants", "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria.

(6) The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage, for each described building insured under this Coverage Form, is $10,000 or 5% of the Limit of Insurance applicable to that building, whichever is less. If a damaged building is covered under a blanket Limit of Insurance which applies to more than one building or item of property, then the most we will pay under this Additional Coverage, for that damaged building, is the lesser of $10,000 or 5% times the value of the damaged building as of the time of loss times the applicable Coinsurance percentage.

The amount payable under this Additional Coverage is additional insurance.

### e. Increased Cost Of Construction

1. This Additional Coverage applies only to buildings to which the Replacement Cost Optional Coverage applies.

2. In the event of damage by a Covered Cause of Loss to a building that is Covered Property, we will pay the increased costs incurred to comply with the minimum standards of an ordinance or law in the course of repair, rebuilding or replacement of damaged parts of that property, subject to the limitations stated in e.(3) through e.(9) of this Additional Coverage.

3. The ordinance or law referred to in e.(2) of this Additional Coverage is an ordinance or law that regulates the construction or repair of buildings or establishes zoning or land use requirements at the described premises and is in force at the time of loss.

4. Under this Additional Coverage, we will not pay any costs due to an ordinance or law that:

   - (a) You were required to comply with before the loss, even when the building was undamaged; and
   - (b) You failed to comply with.

5. With respect to this Additional Coverage:

   - (a) We will not pay for the Increased Cost of Construction:
     - (i) Until the property is actually repaired or replaced at the same or another premises; and
     - (ii) Unless the repair or replacement is made as soon as reasonably possible after the loss or damage, not to exceed two years. We may extend this period in writing during the two years.

With respect to an occurrence which begins in one policy year and continues or results in additional loss or damage in a subsequent policy year(s), all loss or damage is deemed to be sustained in the policy year in which the occurrence began.

   - You have a contractual responsibility to pay for loss or damage to the trailer.

2. We will not pay for any loss or damage that occurs:
   - While the trailer is attached to any motor vehicle or motorized conveyance, whether or not the motor vehicle or motorized conveyance is in motion;

2. If the applicable Covered Causes of Loss form or endorsement contains a limitation or exclusion concerning loss or damage from sand, dust, sleet, snow, ice or rain to property in a structure, such limitation or exclusion also applies to property in a portable storage unit.

3. Coverage under this Extension:
   - Will end 90 days after the business personal property has been placed in the storage unit;
   - Does not apply if the storage unit itself has been in use at the described premises for more than 90 consecutive days, even if the business personal property has been stored there for 90 or fewer days as of the time of loss or damage.

4. Under this Extension, the most we will pay for the total of all loss or damage to business personal property is $10,000 (unless a higher limit is indicated in the Declarations for such Extension) regardless of the number of storage units. Such limit is part of, not in addition to, the applicable Limit of Insurance on Your Business Personal Property. Therefore, payment under this Extension will not increase the applicable Limit of Insurance on Your Business Personal Property.

5. This Extension does not apply to loss or damage otherwise covered under this Coverage Form or any endorsement to this Coverage Form or policy, and does not apply to loss or damage to the storage unit itself.

Each of these Extensions is additional insurance unless otherwise indicated. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to these Extensions.

The amounts of insurance stated in the following Total amount of loss payable:

$59,850 + $80,000 = $139,850

Additional Coverages apply in accordance with the terms of such coverages and are separate from the Limit(s) Of Insurance shown in the Declarations for any other coverage:

(This example, too, assumes there is no Coinsurance penalty.)

1. Fire Department Service Charge;
2. Pollutant Clean-up And Removal;
3. Increased Cost Of Construction; and
4. Electronic Data.

Payments under the Preservation Of Property Additional Coverage will not increase the applicable Limit of Insurance.

### D. Deductible

In any one occurrence of loss or damage (hereinafter referred to as loss), we will first reduce the amount of loss if required by the Coinsurance Condition or the Agreed Value Optional Coverage. If the adjusted amount of loss is less than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for that loss. If the adjusted amount of loss exceeds the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deductible from the adjusted amount of loss and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

When the occurrence involves loss to more than one item of Covered Property and separate Limits of Insurance apply, the losses will not be combined in determining application of the Deductible. But the Deductible will be applied only once per occurrence.

#### Example 1

(This example assumes there is no Coinsurance penalty.)

- **Deductible:** $250
- **Limit of Insurance – Building 1:** $60,000
- **Limit of Insurance – Building 2:** $80,000

- **Loss to Building 1:** $60,100
- **Loss to Building 2:** $90,000

The amount of loss to Building 1 ($60,100) is less than the sum ($60,250) of the Limit of Insurance applicable to Building 1 plus the Deductible. The Deductible will be subtracted from the amount of loss in calculating the loss payable for Building 1:

```
$ 60,100
- 250
$ 59,850 Loss Payable – Building 1
```

The Deductible applies once per occurrence and therefore is not subtracted in determining the amount of loss payable for Building 2. Loss payable for Building 2 is the Limit of Insurance of $80,000.

### E. Loss Conditions

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions:

1. **Abandonment**

   There can be no abandonment of any property to us.

2. **Appraisal**

   If we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

   a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and  
   b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

   If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

3. **Duties In The Event Of Loss Or Damage**

   a. You must see that the following are done in the event of loss or damage to Covered Property:

   (1) Notify the police if a law may have been broken.

c. We will give notice of our intentions within 30 days after we receive the sworn proof of loss.

d. We will not pay you more than your financial interest in the Covered Property.

## Important Requirements

### 1. Party Wall

A party wall is a wall that separates and is common to adjoining buildings that are owned by different parties. In settling covered losses involving a party wall, we will pay a proportion of the loss to the party wall based on your interest in the wall in proportion to the interest of the owner of the adjoining building. However, if you elect to repair or replace your building and the owner of the adjoining building elects not to repair or replace that building, we will pay you the full value of the loss to the party wall, subject to all applicable policy provisions including Limits of Insurance, the Valuation and Coinsurance Conditions, and all other provisions of this Loss Payment Condition. Our payment under the provisions of this paragraph does not alter any right of subrogation we may have against any entity, including the owner or insurer of the adjoining building, and does not alter the terms of the Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us Condition in this policy.

### 2. Recovered Property

If either you or we recover any property after loss settlement, that party must give the other prompt notice. At your option, the property will be returned to you. You must then return to us the amount we paid to you for the property. We will pay recovery expenses and the expenses to repair the recovered property, subject to the Limit of Insurance.

### 3. Vacancy

#### a. Description Of Terms

1. As used in this Vacancy Condition, the term `building` and the term `vacant` have the meanings set forth in (1)(a) and (1)(b) below:

   - **(a)** When this policy is issued to a tenant, and with respect to that tenant's interest in Covered Property, `building` means the unit or suite rented or leased to the tenant. Such building is vacant when it does not contain enough business personal property to conduct customary operations.

   - **(b)** When this policy is issued to the owner or general lessee of a building, `building` means the entire building. Such building is vacant unless at least 31% of its total square footage is:
     - (i) Rented to a lessee or sublessee and used by the lessee or sublessee to conduct its customary operations; and/or
     - (ii) Used by the building owner to conduct customary operations.

2. Buildings under construction or renovation are not considered vacant.

#### b. Vacancy Provisions

If the building where loss or damage occurs has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days before that loss or damage occurs:

1. We will not pay for any loss or damage caused by any of the following, even if they are Covered Causes of Loss:
   - **(a)** Vandalism;
   - **(b)** Sprinkler leakage, unless you have protected the system against freezing;
   - **(c)** Building glass breakage;
   - **(d)** Water damage;
   - **(e)** Theft; or
   - **(f)** Attempted theft.

2. With respect to Covered Causes of Loss other than those listed in b.(1)(a) through b.(1)(f) above, we will reduce the amount we would otherwise pay for the loss or damage by 15%.

### 4. Valuation

We will determine the value of Covered Property in the event of loss or damage as follows:

- **a.** At actual cash value as of the time of loss or damage, except as provided in b., c., d., and e. below.

- **b.** If the Limit of Insurance for Building satisfies the Additional Condition, Coinsurance, and the cost to repair or replace the damaged building property is $2,500 or less, we will pay the cost of building repairs or replacement.

```

```markdown
The cost of building repairs or replacement does not include the increased cost attributable to enforcement of or compliance with any ordinance or law regulating the construction, use, or repair of any property. Instead, we will determine the most we will pay using the following steps:

1. Multiply the value of Covered Property at the time of loss by the Coinsurance percentage;
2. Divide the Limit of Insurance of the property by the figure determined in Step (1);
3. Multiply the total amount of loss, before the application of any deductible, by the figure determined in Step (2); and
4. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in Step (3).

We will pay the amount determined in Step (4) or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less. For the remainder, you will either have to rely on other insurance or absorb the loss yourself.

However, the following property will be valued at the actual cash value, even when attached to the building:

- Awnings or floor coverings;
- Appliances for refrigerating, ventilating, cooking, dishwashing, or laundering; or
- Outdoor equipment or furniture.

c. "Stock" you have sold but not delivered at the selling price less discounts and expenses you otherwise would have had.

d. Glass at the cost of replacement with safety-glazing material if required by law.

e. Tenants' Improvements and Betterments at:

   1. Actual cash value of the lost or damaged property if you make repairs promptly.
   2. A proportion of your original cost if you do not make repairs promptly. We will determine the proportionate value as follows:
      - Multiply the original cost by the number of days from the loss or damage to the expiration of the lease; and
      - Divide the amount determined in (a) above by the number of days from the installation of improvements to the expiration of the lease.

If your lease contains a renewal option, the expiration of the renewal option period will replace the expiration of the lease in this procedure.

3. Nothing if others pay for repairs or replacement.

## F. Additional Conditions

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions:

### 1. Coinsurance

If a Coinsurance percentage is shown in the Declarations, the following condition applies:

a. We will not pay the full amount of any loss if the value of Covered Property at the time of loss times the Coinsurance percentage shown for it in the Declarations is greater than the Limit of Insurance for the property.

**Example 1 (Underinsurance)**

- **When:** The value of the property is: $250,000
- The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 80%
- The Limit of Insurance for it is: $100,000
- The Deductible is: $250
- The amount of loss is: $40,000

**Step (1):**  
$250,000 x 80% = $200,000  
(the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirements)

**Step (2):**  
$100,000 ÷ $200,000 = .50

**Step (3):**  
$40,000 x .50 = $20,000

**Step (4):**  
$20,000 – $250 = $19,750

We will pay no more than $19,750. The remaining $20,250 is not covered.

**Example 2 (Adequate Insurance)**

- **When:** The value of the property is: $250,000
- The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 80%
- The Limit of Insurance for it is: $200,000
- The Deductible is: $250
- The amount of loss is: $40,000

The minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($250,000 x 80%). Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this example is adequate, and no penalty applies. We will pay no more than $39,750 ($40,000 amount of loss minus the deductible of $250).

```

```markdown
b. If one Limit of Insurance applies to two or more separate items, this condition will apply to the total of all property to which the limit applies.

   (2) Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so; and

   (3) Has notified us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk known to the mortgageholder.

All of the terms of this Coverage Part will then apply directly to the mortgageholder.

e. If we pay the mortgageholder for any loss or damage and deny payment to you because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part:

   (1) The mortgageholder's rights under the mortgage will be transferred to us to the extent of the amount we pay; and

   (2) The mortgageholder's right to recover the full amount of the mortgageholder's claim will not be impaired.

At our option, we may pay to the mortgageholder the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, your mortgage and note will be transferred to us and you will pay your remaining mortgage debt to us.

f. If we cancel this policy, we will give written notice to the mortgageholder at least:

   (1) 10 days before the effective date of cancellation if we cancel for your nonpayment of premium; or

   (2) 30 days before the effective date of cancellation if we cancel for any other reason.

g. If we elect not to renew this policy, we will give written notice to the mortgageholder at least 10 days before the expiration date of this policy.

## G. Optional Coverages

If shown as applicable in the Declarations, the following Optional Coverages apply separately to each item:

1. **Agreed Value**

   a. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to Covered Property to which this Optional Coverage applies. We will pay no more for loss of or damage to that property than the proportion that the Limit of Insurance under this Coverage Part for the property bears to the Agreed Value shown for it in the Declarations.

### Example 3

When: The value of the property is:

| Property                      | Value     |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Building at Location 1        | $ 75,000  |
| Building at Location 2        | $100,000  |
| Personal Property at Location 2 | $ 75,000  |
| **Total**                     | **$250,000** |

The Coinsurance percentage for it is: **90%**

The Limit of Insurance for Buildings and Personal Property at Locations 1 and 2 is: **$180,000**

The Deductible is: **$1,000**

The amount of loss is:

| Loss Type                     | Amount    |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Building at Location 2        | $ 30,000  |
| Personal Property at Location 2 | $ 20,000  |
| **Total**                     | **$50,000** |

**Step (1):** $250,000 x 90% = $225,000  
(the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirements and to avoid the penalty shown below)

**Step (2):** $180,000 ÷ $225,000 = .80

**Step (3):** $50,000 x .80 = $40,000

**Step (4):** $40,000 – $1,000 = $39,000

We will pay no more than **$39,000**. The remaining **$11,000** is not covered.

## 2. Mortgageholders

a. The term mortgageholder includes trustee.

b. We will pay for covered loss of or damage to buildings or structures to each mortgageholder shown in the Declarations in their order of precedence, as interests may appear.

c. The mortgageholder has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgageholder has started foreclosure or similar action on the building or structure.

d. If we deny your claim because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part, the mortgageholder will still have the right to receive loss payment if the mortgageholder:

   (1) Pays any premium due under this Coverage Part at our request if you have failed to do so;

   (2) Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so; and

   (3) Has notified us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk known to the mortgageholder.

All of the terms of this Coverage Part will then apply directly to the mortgageholder.

e. If we pay the mortgageholder for any loss or damage and deny payment to you because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part:

   (1) The mortgageholder's rights under the mortgage will be transferred to us to the extent of the amount we pay; and

   (2) The mortgageholder's right to recover the full amount of the mortgageholder's claim will not be impaired.

At our option, we may pay to the mortgageholder the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, your mortgage and note will be transferred to us and you will pay your remaining mortgage debt to us.

f. If we cancel this policy, we will give written notice to the mortgageholder at least:

   (1) 10 days before the effective date of cancellation if we cancel for your nonpayment of premium; or

   (2) 30 days before the effective date of cancellation if we cancel for any other reason.

g. If we elect not to renew this policy, we will give written notice to the mortgageholder at least 10 days before the expiration date of this policy.

# COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

`CP 00 30 10 12`

## BUSINESS INCOME (AND EXTRA EXPENSE) COVERAGE FORM

Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, duties and what is and is not covered.

Throughout this policy, the words "you" and "your" refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations. The words "we", "us" and "our" refer to the company providing this insurance. Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Section F. Definitions.

### A. Coverage

With respect to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph, if you occupy only part of a building, your premises means:

1. **Business Income**

   Business Income means the:

   a. Net Income (Net Profit or Loss before income taxes) that would have been earned or incurred; and

   b. Continuing normal operating expenses incurred, including payroll.

   For manufacturing risks, Net Income includes the net sales value of production.

   Coverage is provided as described and limited below for one or more of the following options for which a Limit Of Insurance is shown in the Declarations:

   - (1) Business Income Including "Rental Value".
   - (2) Business Income Other Than "Rental Value".
   - (3) "Rental Value".

   If option (1) above is selected, the term Business Income will include "Rental Value". If option (3) above is selected, the term Business Income will mean "Rental Value" only.

   If Limits of Insurance are shown under more than one of the above options, the provisions of this Coverage Part apply separately to each.

   We will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you sustain due to the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" during the "period of restoration". The "suspension" must be caused by direct physical loss of or damage to property at premises which are described in the Declarations and for which a Business Income Limit Of Insurance is shown in the Declarations. The loss or damage must be caused by or result from a Covered Cause of Loss. With respect to loss of or damage to personal property in the open or personal property in a vehicle, the described premises include the area within 100 feet of such premises.

   - (a) The portion of the building which you rent, lease or occupy;
   - (b) The area within 100 feet of the building or within 100 feet of the premises described in the Declarations, whichever distance is greater (with respect to loss of or damage to personal property in the open or personal property in a vehicle); and
   - (c) Any area within the building or at the described premises, if that area services, or is used to gain access to, the portion of the building which you rent, lease or occupy.

2. **Extra Expense**

   a. Extra Expense Coverage is provided at the premises described in the Declarations only if the Declarations show that Business Income Coverage applies at that premises.

   b. Extra Expense means necessary expenses you incur during the "period of restoration" that you would not have incurred if there had been no direct physical loss or damage to property caused by or resulting from a Covered Cause of Loss.

   We will pay Extra Expense (other than the expense to repair or replace property) to:

   - (1) Avoid or minimize the "suspension" of business and to continue operations at the described premises or at replacement premises or temporary locations, including relocation expenses and costs to equip and operate the replacement location or temporary location.

## (2) Minimize the "suspension" of business if you cannot continue "operations".

### 5. Additional Coverages

#### a. Civil Authority

We will also pay Extra Expense to repair or replace property, but only to the extent it reduces the amount of loss that otherwise would have been payable under this Coverage Form.

In this Additional Coverage, Civil Authority, the described premises are premises to which this Coverage Form applies, as shown in the Declarations.

When a Covered Cause of Loss causes damage to property other than property at the described premises, we will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you sustain and necessary Extra Expense caused by action of civil authority that prohibits access to the described premises, provided that both of the following apply:

1. Access to the area immediately surrounding the damaged property is prohibited by civil authority as a result of the damage, and the described premises are within that area but are not more than one mile from the damaged property; and

2. The action of civil authority is taken in response to dangerous physical conditions resulting from the damage or continuation of the Covered Cause of Loss that caused the damage, or the action is taken to enable a civil authority to have unimpeded access to the damaged property.

Civil Authority Coverage for Business Income will begin 72 hours after the time of the first action of civil authority that prohibits access to the described premises and will apply for a period of up to four consecutive weeks from the date on which such coverage began.

Civil Authority Coverage for Extra Expense will begin immediately after the time of the first action of civil authority that prohibits access to the described premises and will end:

1. Four consecutive weeks after the date of that action; or

2. When your Civil Authority Coverage for Business Income ends;

whichever is later.

### 3. Covered Causes Of Loss, Exclusions And Limitations

See applicable Causes Of Loss form as shown in the Declarations.

### 4. Additional Limitation – Interruption Of Computer Operations

a. Coverage for Business Income does not apply when a "suspension" of "operations" is caused by destruction or corruption of electronic data, or any loss or damage to electronic data, except as provided under the Additional Coverage, Interruption Of Computer Operations.

b. Coverage for Extra Expense does not apply when action is taken to avoid or minimize a "suspension" of "operations" caused by destruction or corruption of electronic data, or any loss or damage to electronic data, except as provided under the Additional Coverage, Interruption Of Computer Operations.

c. Electronic data means information, facts or computer programs stored as or on, created or used on, or transmitted to or from computer software (including systems and applications software), on hard or floppy disks, CD-ROMs, tapes, drives, cells, data processing devices or any other repositories of computer software which are used with electronically controlled equipment. The term computer programs, referred to in the foregoing description of electronic data, means a set of related electronic instructions which direct the operations and functions of a computer or device connected to it, which enable the computer or device to receive, process, store, retrieve or send data.

d. This Additional Limitation does not apply when loss or damage to electronic data involves only electronic data which is integrated in and operates or controls a building's elevator, lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning or security system.

2. Alterations or additions to existing buildings or structures; and
3. Machinery, equipment, supplies or building materials located on or within 100 feet of the described premises and:
   - Used in the construction, alterations or additions; or

If such direct physical loss or damage delays the start of "operations", the "period of restoration" for Business Income Coverage will begin on the date "operations" would have begun if the direct physical loss or damage had not occurred.

## c. Extended Business Income

### 1. Business Income Other Than "Rental Value"

If the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" produces a Business Income loss payable under this policy, we will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you incur during the period that:

- **(a)** Begins on the date property (except "finished stock") is actually repaired, rebuilt or replaced and "operations" are resumed; and
- **(b)** Ends on the earlier of:
  - **(i)** The date you could restore your "operations", with reasonable speed, to the level which would generate the business income amount that would have existed if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred; or
  - **(ii)** 60 consecutive days after the date determined in (1)(a) above.

However, Extended Business Income does not apply to loss of Business Income incurred as a result of unfavorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss in the area where the described premises are located.

Loss of Business Income must be caused by direct physical loss or damage at the described premises caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.

### 2. "Rental Value"

If the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" produces a "Rental Value" loss payable under this policy, we will pay for the actual loss of "Rental Value" you incur during the period that:

- **(a)** Begins on the date property is actually repaired, rebuilt or replaced and tenantability is restored; and
- **(b)** Ends on the earlier of:
  - **(i)** The date you could restore tenant occupancy, with reasonable speed, to the level which would generate the "Rental Value" that would have existed if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred; or
  - **(ii)** 60 consecutive days after the date determined in (2)(a) above.

However, Extended Business Income does not apply to loss of "Rental Value" incurred as a result of unfavorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss in the area where the described premises are located.

Loss of "Rental Value" must be caused by direct physical loss or damage at the described premises caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.

### Additional Coverage: Interruption Of Computer Operations

1. **Subject to all provisions of this Additional Coverage**, you may extend the insurance that applies to Business Income and Extra Expense to apply to a "suspension" of "operations" caused by an interruption in computer operations due to destruction or corruption of electronic data due to a Covered Cause of Loss. However, we will not provide coverage under this Additional Coverage when the Additional Limitation – Interruption Of Computer Operations does not apply based on Paragraph A.4.d. therein.

2. **With respect to the coverage provided under this Additional Coverage**, the Covered Causes of Loss are subject to the following:

   - **(a)** If the Causes Of Loss – Special Form applies, coverage under this Additional Coverage, Interruption Of Computer Operations, is limited to the "specified causes of loss" as defined in that form and Collapse as set forth in that form.
   
   - **(b)** If the Causes Of Loss – Broad Form applies, coverage under this Additional Coverage, Interruption Of Computer Operations, includes Collapse as set forth in that form.
   
   - **(c)** If the Causes Of Loss form is endorsed to add a Covered Cause of Loss, the additional Covered Cause of Loss does not apply to the coverage provided under this Additional Coverage, Interruption Of Computer Operations.
   
   - **(d)** The Covered Causes of Loss include a virus, harmful code or similar instruction introduced into or enacted on a computer system (including electronic data) or a network to which it is connected, designed to damage or destroy any part of the system or disrupt its normal operation. But there is no coverage for an interruption related to manipulation of a computer system (including electronic data) by any employee, including a temporary or leased employee, or by an entity retained by you or for you to inspect, design, install, maintain, repair or replace that system.

3. **The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage**, Interruption Of Computer Operations, is $2,500 (unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations) for all loss sustained and expense incurred in any one policy year, regardless of the number of interruptions or the number of premises, locations or computer systems involved. If loss payment relating to the first interruption does not exhaust this amount, then the balance is available for loss or expense sustained or incurred as a result of subsequent interruptions in that policy year. A balance remaining at the end of a policy year does not increase the amount of insurance in the next policy year. With respect to any interruption which begins in one policy year and continues or results in additional loss or expense in a subsequent policy year(s), all loss and expense is deemed to be sustained or incurred in the policy year in which the interruption began.

4. **This Additional Coverage, Interruption Of Computer Operations**, does not apply to loss sustained or expense incurred after the end of the "period of restoration", even if the amount of insurance stated in (4) above has not been exhausted.

### Coverage Extension

   1. Notify the police if a law may have been broken.

   2. Give us prompt notice of the direct physical loss or damage. Include a description of the property involved.

   3. As soon as possible, give us a description of how, when and where the direct physical loss or damage occurred.

   4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for any subsequent loss or damage resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.

   5. As often as may be reasonably required, permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records. Also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection, testing and analysis, and permit us to make copies from your books and records.

   6. Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss containing the information we request to investigate the claim. You must do this within 60 days after our request. We will supply you with the necessary forms.

   7. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.

### C. Loss Conditions

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions:

#### 1. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the amount of Net Income and operating expense or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the amount of Net Income and operating expense or amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

- a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
- b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

The likely Net Income of the business if no physical loss or damage had occurred, but not including any Net Income that would likely have been earned as a result of an increase in the volume of business due to favorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss on customers or on other businesses;

      - (b) Bills, invoices and other vouchers; and

b. The amount of Extra Expense will be determined based on:

   1. All expenses that exceed the normal operating expenses that would have been incurred by "operations" during the "period of restoration" if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred. We will deduct from the total of such expenses:
      - (a) The salvage value that remains of any property bought for temporary use during the "period of restoration", once "operations" are resumed; and
      - (b) Any Extra Expense that is paid for by other insurance, except for insurance that is written subject to the same plan, terms, conditions and provisions as this insurance; and

   2. Necessary expenses that reduce the Business Income loss that otherwise would have been incurred.

We will reduce the amount of your:

- (1) Business Income loss, other than Extra Expense, to the extent you can resume your "operations", in whole or in part, by using damaged or undamaged property (including merchandise or stock) at the described premises or elsewhere.

- (2) Extra Expense loss to the extent you can return "operations" to normal and discontinue such Extra Expense.

d. If you do not resume "operations", or do not resume "operations" as quickly as possible, we will pay based on the length of time it would have taken to resume "operations" as quickly as possible.

### 4. Loss Payment

## Important Requirements

Instead, we will determine the most we will pay **Example 1 (Underinsurance)** using the following steps:

**When:** The Net Income and operating expenses for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy at the described premises would have been: **$400,000**

- **Step (1):** Multiply the Net Income and operating expense for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy by the Coinsurance percentage;
  - **The Coinsurance percentage is:** 50%
  - **Step (1):** $400,000 x 50% = $200,000 (the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirements)

- **Step (2):** Divide the Limit of Insurance for the described premises by the figure determined in Step (1);
  - **The Limit of Insurance is:** $150,000
  - **Step (2):** $150,000 ÷ $200,000 = .75

- **Step (3):** Multiply the total amount of loss by the figure determined in Step (2).
  - **The amount of loss is:** $80,000
  - **Step (3):** $80,000 x .75 = $60,000

We will pay the amount determined in Step (3) or the limit of insurance, whichever is less. For the remainder, you will either have to rely on other insurance or absorb the loss yourself.

- **We will pay no more than $60,000.** The remaining $20,000 is not covered.

### Example 2 (Adequate Insurance)

**When:** The Net Income and operating expenses for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy at the described premises would have been: **$400,000**

- **The Coinsurance percentage is:** 50%
- **The Limit of Insurance is:** $200,000
- **The amount of loss is:** $80,000

The minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($400,000 x 50%). Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this example is adequate and no penalty applies. We will pay no more than $80,000 (amount of loss).

This condition does not apply to Extra Expense Coverage.

### E. Optional Coverages

If shown as applicable in the Declarations, the following Optional Coverages apply separately to each item.

1. **Maximum Period Of Indemnity**
   - a. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to this Coverage Form at the described premises to which this Optional Coverage applies.

In determining operating expenses for the purpose of applying the Coinsurance condition, the following expenses, if applicable, shall be deducted from the total of all operating expenses:

2. The expiration date of this policy; whichever occurs first.

c. We will reinstate the Additional Condition, Coinsurance, automatically if you do not submit a new Work Sheet and Agreed Value:

1. Within 12 months of the effective date of this Optional Coverage; or
2. When you request a change in your Business Income Limit of Insurance.

d. If the Business Income Limit of Insurance is less than the Agreed Value, we will not pay more of any loss than the amount of loss multiplied by:

1. The Business Income Limit of Insurance; divided by
2. The Agreed Value.

**Example**

- When: The Limit of Insurance is: $100,000
- The Agreed Value is: $200,000
- The amount of loss is: $80,000

Step (1): $100,000 ÷ $200,000 = .50  
Step (2): .50 x $80,000 = $40,000

The remaining $10,000 is not covered. We will pay $40,000. The remaining $40,000 is not covered.

### 4. Extended Period Of Indemnity

Under Paragraph A.5.c., Extended Business Income, the number 60 in Subparagraphs (1)(b) and (2)(b) is replaced by the number shown in the Declarations for this Optional Coverage.

## Important Requirements

### E. Additional Coverage – Limited Coverage For "Fungus", Wet Rot, Dry Rot And Bacteria

1. The coverage described in E.2. and E.6. only applies when the "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria are the result of one or more of the following causes that occur during the policy period and only if all reasonable means were used to save and preserve the property from further damage at the time of and after that occurrence:

   a. A "specified cause of loss" other than fire or lightning; or  
   b. Flood, if the Flood Coverage Endorsement applies to the affected premises.

   This Additional Coverage does not apply to lawns, trees, shrubs or plants which are part of a vegetated roof.

2. We will pay for loss or damage by "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria. As used in this Limited Coverage, the term loss or damage means:

   a. Direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property caused by "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria, including the cost of removal of the "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria;  
   b. The cost to tear out and replace any part of the building or other property as needed to gain access to the "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria; and  
   c. The cost of testing performed after removal, repair, replacement or restoration of the damaged property is completed, provided there is a reason to believe that "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria are present.

3. The coverage described under E.2. of this Limited Coverage is limited to **$15,000**. Regardless of the number of claims, this limit is the most we will pay for the total of all loss or damage arising out of all occurrences of "specified causes of loss" (other than fire or lightning) and Flood which take place in a 12-month period (starting with the beginning of the present annual policy period). With respect to a particular occurrence of loss which results in "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria, we will not pay more than a total of **$15,000** even if the "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria continue to be present or active, or recur, in a later policy period.

### Collapse Coverage

4. If an abrupt collapse is caused by a cause of loss listed in 2.a. through 2.d., we will pay for loss or damage to that property only if:

   1. Such loss or damage is a direct result of the abrupt collapse of a building insured under this Coverage Form; and  
   2. The property is Covered Property under this Coverage Form.

5. If personal property abruptly falls down or caves in and such collapse is not the result of abrupt collapse of a building, we will pay for loss or damage to Covered Property caused by such collapse of personal property only if:

   a. The collapse of personal property was caused by a cause of loss listed in 2.a. through 2.d.;  
   b. The personal property which collapses is inside a building; and  
   c. The property which collapses is not of a kind listed in 4., regardless of whether that kind of property is considered to be personal property or real property.

   The coverage stated in this Paragraph 5. does not apply to personal property if marring and/or scratching is the only damage to that personal property caused by the collapse.

6. This Additional Coverage, Collapse, does not apply to personal property that has not abruptly fallen down or caved in, even if the personal property shows evidence of cracking, bulging, sagging, bending, leaning, settling, shrinkage or expansion.

7. This Additional Coverage, Collapse, will not increase the Limits of Insurance provided in this Coverage Part.

8. The term Covered Cause of Loss includes the Additional Coverage, Collapse, as described and limited in D.1. through D.7.

### 4. The coverage provided under this Limited Coverage does not increase the applicable Limit of Insurance on any Covered Property.

If a particular occurrence results in loss or damage by "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria, and other loss or damage, we will not pay more, for the total of all loss or damage, than the applicable Limit of Insurance on the affected Covered Property.

If there is covered loss or damage to Covered Property, not caused by "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria, loss payment will not be limited by the terms of this Limited Coverage, except to the extent that "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria cause an increase in the loss. Any such increase in the loss will be subject to the terms of this Limited Coverage.

5. The terms of this Limited Coverage do not increase or reduce the coverage provided under Paragraph F.2. (Water Damage, Other Liquids, Powder Or Molten Material Damage) of this Causes Of Loss form or under the Additional Coverage, Collapse.

6. The following, 6.a. or 6.b., applies only if Business Income and/or Extra Expense Coverage applies to the described premises and only if the "suspension" of "operations" satisfies all terms and conditions of the applicable Business Income and/or Extra Expense Coverage Form:

   a. If the loss which resulted in "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria does not in itself necessitate a "suspension" of "operations", but such "suspension" is necessary due to loss or damage to property caused by "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria, then our payment under Business Income and/or Extra Expense is limited to the amount of loss and/or expense sustained in a period of not more than 30 days. The days need not be consecutive.

   b. If a covered "suspension" of "operations" was caused by loss or damage other than "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria but remediation of "fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria prolongs the "period of restoration", we will pay for loss and/or expense sustained during the delay (regardless of when such a delay occurs during the "period of restoration"), but such coverage is limited to 30 days. The days need not be consecutive.

## F. Additional Coverage Extensions

### 1. Property In Transit

This Extension applies only to your personal property to which this form applies.

- **a.** You may extend the insurance provided by this Coverage Part to apply to your personal property (other than property in the care, custody or control of your salespersons) in transit more than 100 feet from the described premises. Property must be in or on a motor vehicle you own, lease or operate while between points in the coverage territory.

- **b.** Loss or damage must be caused by or result from one of the following causes of loss:
  1. Fire, lightning, explosion, windstorm or hail, riot or civil commotion, or vandalism.
  2. Vehicle collision, upset or overturn. Collision means accidental contact of your vehicle with another vehicle or object. It does not mean your vehicle's contact with the roadbed.
  3. Theft of an entire bale, case or package by forced entry into a securely locked body or compartment of the vehicle. There must be visible marks of the forced entry.

- **c.** The most we will pay for loss or damage under this Extension is $5,000.

This Coverage Extension is additional insurance. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to this Extension.

### 2. Water Damage, Other Liquids, Powder Or Molten Material Damage

If loss or damage caused by or resulting from covered water or other liquid, powder or molten material damage loss occurs, we will also pay the cost to tear out and replace any part of the building or structure to repair damage to the system or appliance from which the water or other substance escapes. This Coverage Extension does not increase the Limit of Insurance.

```markdown
### 3. Glass

1. **Accidental discharge or leakage of water or waterborne material** as the direct result of the breaking apart or cracking of a water or sewer pipe

   a. We will pay for expenses incurred to put up temporary plates or board up openings if repair or replacement of damaged glass is delayed.

   b. We will pay for expenses incurred to remove or replace obstructions when repairing or replacing glass that is part of a building. This does not include removing or replacing window displays.

This Coverage Extension F.3. does not increase the Limit of Insurance.

### G. Definitions

1. **"Fungus"** means any type or form of fungus, including mold or mildew, and any mycotoxins, spores, scents or by-products produced or released by fungi.

2. **"Specified causes of loss"** means the following: fire; lightning; explosion; windstorm or hail; smoke; aircraft or vehicles; riot or civil commotion; vandalism; leakage from fire-extinguishing equipment; sinkhole collapse; volcanic action; falling objects; weight of snow, ice or sleet; water damage.

   a. **Sinkhole collapse** means the sudden sinking or collapse of land into underground empty spaces created by the action of water on limestone or dolomite. This cause of loss does not include:

      1. The cost of filling sinkholes; or

      2. Sinking or collapse of land into man-made underground cavities.

   b. **Falling objects** does not include loss or damage to:

      1. Personal property in the open; or

      2. The interior of a building or structure, or property inside a building or structure, unless the roof or an outside wall of the building or structure is first damaged by a falling object.

   c. **Water damage** means:

      1. Accidental discharge or leakage of water or steam as the direct result of the breaking apart or cracking of a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or other system or appliance (other than a sump system including its related equipment and parts), that is located on the described premises and contains water or steam; and

      2. Accidental discharge or leakage of water or waterborne material as the direct result of the breaking apart or cracking of a water or sewer pipe caused by wear and tear, when the pipe is located off the described premises and is connected to or is part of a potable water supply system or sanitary sewer system operated by a public or private utility service provider pursuant to authority granted by the state or governmental subdivision where the described premises are located.

But water damage does not include loss or damage otherwise excluded under the terms of the Water Exclusion. Therefore, for example, there is no coverage under this policy in the situation in which discharge or leakage of water results from the breaking apart or cracking of a pipe which was caused by or related to weather-induced flooding, even if wear and tear contributed to the breakage or cracking. As another example, and also in accordance with the terms of the Water Exclusion, there is no coverage for loss or damage caused by or related to weather-induced flooding which follows or is exacerbated by pipe breakage or cracking attributable to wear and tear.

To the extent that accidental discharge or leakage of water falls within the criteria set forth in c.(1) or c.(2) of this definition of "specified causes of loss," such water is not subject to the provisions of the Water Exclusion which preclude coverage for surface water or water under the surface of the ground.

### 6. Final Settlement Between Insurers

Liquidated Damages are defined as interest from the date the insured invokes this Agreement to the date the insurer(s) that contributed the excess amount is reimbursed. The interest is calculated at 1.5 times the highest prime rate from the Money Rates column of the Wall Street Journal during the period of the Liquidated Damages.

Arbitration expenses will be apportioned between insurers on the same basis that the ultimate loss is apportioned.

### 4. Other Insurance

1. **Primary Insurance**

   This insurance is primary except when Paragraph b. below applies. If this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in Paragraph c. below.

2. **Excess Insurance**

   1. This insurance is excess over:

      - Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis:
        1. That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builder's Risk, Installation Risk or similar coverage for "your work";
        2. That is Fire insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner;
        3. That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for "property damage" to premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; or
        4. If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use of aircraft, "autos" or watercraft to the extent not subject to Exclusion g. of Section I – Coverage A – Bodily Injury And Property Damage Liability.

      - Any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations, or the products and completed operations, for which you have been added as an additional insured.

   2. When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the insured against any "suit" if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that "suit". If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the insured's rights against all those other insurers.

   3. When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of:
      - The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance; and
      - The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance.

   4. We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part.

3. **Method Of Sharing**

   If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first.

   If any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.

### 5. Premium Audit

2. Premium shown in this Coverage Part as advance premium is a deposit premium only.

The due date for audit and retrospective premiums is the date shown as the due date on the bill. If the sum of the advance and audit premiums paid for the policy period is greater than the earned premium, we will return the excess to the first Named Insured.

3. The first Named Insured must keep records of the information we need for premium computation, and send us copies at such times as we may request.

b. Separately to each insured against whom claim is made or "suit" is brought.

8. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us

## SECTION IV – BUSINESS AUTO CONDITIONS

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions:

### A. Loss Conditions

1. **Appraisal For Physical Damage Loss**

   If you and we disagree on the amount of "loss", either may demand an appraisal of the "loss". In this event, each party will select a competent appraiser. The two appraisers will select a competent and impartial umpire. The appraisers will state separately the actual cash value and amount of "loss". If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

   a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and  
   b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

   If we submit to an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

2. **Duties In The Event Of Accident, Claim, Suit Or Loss**

   We have no duty to provide coverage under this policy unless there has been full compliance with the following duties:

   a. In the event of "accident", claim, "suit" or "loss", you must give us or our authorized representative prompt notice of the "accident" or "loss". Include:

      (1) How, when and where the "accident" or "loss" occurred;  
      (2) The "insured's" name and address; and  
      (3) To the extent possible, the names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses.

   b. Additionally, you and any other involved "insured" must:

      (1) Assume no obligation, make no payment or incur no expense without our consent, except at the "insured's" own cost.  
      (2) Immediately send us copies of any request, demand, order, notice, summons or legal paper received concerning the claim or "suit".  
      (3) Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim or defense against the "suit".  
      (4) Authorize us to obtain medical records or other pertinent information.  
      (5) Submit to examination, at our expense, by physicians of our choice, as often as we reasonably require.

   c. If there is "loss" to a covered "auto" or its equipment, you must also do the following:

      (1) Promptly notify the police if the covered "auto" or any of its equipment is stolen.  
      (2) Take all reasonable steps to protect the covered "auto" from further damage. Also keep a record of your expenses for consideration in the settlement of the claim.  
      (3) Permit us to inspect the covered "auto" and records proving the "loss" before its repair or disposition.  
      (4) Agree to examinations under oath at our request and give us a signed statement of your answers.

3. **Legal Action Against Us**

   No one may bring a legal action against us under this Coverage Form until:

   a. There has been full compliance with all the terms of this Coverage Form; and  
   b. Under Covered Autos Liability Coverage, we agree in writing that the "insured" has an obligation to pay or until the amount of that obligation has finally been determined by judgment after trial. No one has the right under this policy to bring us into an action to determine the "insured's" liability.

### D. Deductible

## 4. Loss Payment – Physical Damage Coverages

b. Return the stolen property, at our expense. We will pay for any damage that results to the "auto" from the theft; or

c. Take all or any part of the damaged or stolen property at an agreed or appraised value.

If we pay for the "loss", our payment will include the applicable sales tax for the damaged or stolen property.

## 5. Other Insurance

a. For any covered "auto" you own, this Coverage Form provides primary insurance. For any covered "auto" you don't own, the insurance provided by this Coverage Form is excess over any other collectible insurance. However, while a covered "auto" which is a "trailer" is connected to another vehicle, the Covered Autos Liability Coverage this Coverage Form provides for the "trailer" is:

   1. Excess while it is connected to a motor vehicle you do not own; or

   2. Primary while it is connected to a covered "auto" you own.

b. For Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage, any covered "auto" you lease, hire, rent or borrow is deemed to be a covered "auto" you own. However, any "auto" that is leased, hired, rented or borrowed with a driver is not a covered "auto".

c. Regardless of the provisions of Paragraph a. above, this Coverage Form's Covered Autos Liability Coverage is primary for any liability assumed under an "insured contract".

d. When this Coverage Form and any other Coverage Form or policy covers on the same basis, either excess or primary, we will pay only our share. Our share is the proportion that the Limit of Insurance of our Coverage Form bears to the total of the limits of all the Coverage Forms and policies covering on the same basis.

## 6. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us

If any person or organization to or for whom we make payment under this Coverage Form has rights to recover damages from another, those rights are transferred to us. That person or organization must do everything necessary to secure our rights and must do nothing after "accident" or "loss" to impair them.

## B. General Conditions

### 1. Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy or insolvency of the "insured" or the "insured's" estate will not relieve us of any obligations under this Coverage Form.

### 2. Concealment, Misrepresentation Or Fraud

This Coverage Form is void in any case of fraud by you at any time as it relates to this Coverage Form. It is also void if you or any other "insured", at any time, intentionally conceals or misrepresents a material fact concerning:

- a. This Coverage Form;
- b. The covered "auto";
- c. Your interest in the covered "auto"; or
- d. A claim under this Coverage Form.

### 3. Liberalization

If we revise this Coverage Form to provide more coverage without additional premium charge, your policy will automatically provide the additional coverage as of the day the revision is effective in your state.

### 4. No Benefit To Bailee – Physical Damage Coverages

We will not recognize any assignment or grant any coverage for the benefit of any person or organization holding, storing or transporting property for a fee regardless of any other provision of this Coverage Form.

### 5. Premium Audit

a. The estimated premium for this Coverage Form is based on the exposures you told us you would have when this policy began. We will compute the final premium due when we determine your actual exposures. The estimated total premium will be credited against the final premium due and the first Named Insured will be billed for the balance, if any. The due date for the final premium or retrospective premium is the date shown as the due date on the bill. If the estimated total premium exceeds the final premium due, the first Named Insured will get a refund.

b. If this policy is issued for more than one year, the premium for this Coverage Form will be computed annually based on our rates or premiums in effect at the beginning of each year of the policy.

## Two Or More Coverage Forms Or Policies Issued By Us

# DISCLOSURE FORM

## CLAIMS-MADE POLICY

### COLORADO

**IMPORTANT NOTICE TO POLICYHOLDERS**

THIS DISCLOSURE FORM IS NOT YOUR POLICY. IT MERELY DESCRIBES SOME OF THE MAJOR FEATURES OF OUR CLAIMS-MADE POLICY FORM. PLEASE READ YOUR POLICY CAREFULLY TO DETERMINE RIGHTS, DUTIES, AND WHAT IS AND IS NOT COVERED. ONLY THE PROVISIONS OF YOUR POLICY DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF YOUR INSURANCE PROTECTION.

### YOUR POLICY

Your policy is a claims-made policy. It provides coverage only for injury or damage occurring after the policy retroactive date (if any) shown on your policy and the incident is reported to your insurer prior to the end of the policy period. Upon termination of your claims-made policy an extended reporting period option is available from your insurer.

There is no difference in the kind of injury or damage covered by occurrence or claims-made policies. Claims for damages may be assigned to different policy periods, depending on which type of policy you have.

If you make a claim under your claims-made policy, the claim must be a demand for damages by an injured party and does not have to be in writing. Under most circumstances, a claim is considered made when it is received and recorded by you or by us. Sometimes, a claim may be deemed made at an earlier time. This can happen when another claim for the same injury or damage has already been made, or when the claim is received and recorded during an extended reporting period.

### PRINCIPAL BENEFITS

This policy provides for **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS LIABILITY** Coverage up to the maximum dollar limit specified in the policy.

The principal benefits and coverages are explained in detail in your claims-made policy. Please read it carefully and consult your insurance producer about any questions you might have.

### EXCEPTIONS, REDUCTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Your claims-made policy contains certain exceptions, reductions and limitations. Please read them carefully and consult your insurance producer about any questions you might have.

### RENEWALS AND EXTENDED REPORTING PERIODS

Your claims-made policy has some unique features relating to renewal, extended reporting periods, and coverage for events with long periods of exposure.

If there is a retroactive date in your policy, no event or occurrence prior to that date will be covered under the policy even if reported during the policy period. It is therefore important for you to be certain that there are no gaps in your insurance coverage. These gaps can occur in several ways. Among the most common are:

1. If you switch from an occurrence policy to a claims-made policy, the retroactive date in your claims-made policy should be no later than the expiration date of the occurrence policy.

Page 1 of 2
```

---

```markdown
CO-Disclosure (12-04)

2. When replacing a claims-made policy with a claims-made policy, you should consider the following:

   a. The retroactive date in the replacement policy should extend far enough back in time to cover any events with long periods of liability exposure, or

   b. If the retroactive date in the replacement policy does not extend far enough back in time to cover events with long periods of liability exposure, you should consider purchasing extended reporting period coverage under the old claims-made policy.

3. If you replace this claims-made policy with an occurrence policy, you may not have insurance coverage for a claim arising during the period of claims-made coverage unless you have purchased an extended reporting period under the claims-made policy. Extended reporting period coverage must be offered to you by law for at least one year after the expiration of the claims-made policy at a premium not to exceed 200% of your last policy premium.

**CAREFULLY REVIEW YOUR POLICY REGARDING THE AVAILABLE EXTENDED REPORTING PERIOD COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF COVERAGE, THE PRICE AND THE TIME PERIOD DURING WHICH YOU MUST PURCHASE OR ACCEPT ANY OFFER FOR EXTENDED REPORTING PERIOD COVERAGE.**

The Limits of Insurance of this Coverage Part apply separately to each consecutive annual period and to any remaining period of less than 12 months, starting with the beginning of the policy period shown in the Declarations, unless the policy period is extended after issuance for an additional period of less than 12 months. In that case, the additional period will be deemed part of the last preceding period for purposes of determining the Limits of Insurance.

### C. Duties In The Event Of Professional Incident, Claim Or Suit

1. You must see to it that we are notified as soon as practicable of a “professional incident” which may result in a claim. To the extent possible, notice should include:

   a. All available information about the circumstances concerning the “professional incident” including:

      1. How, when and where it took place; and
      2. The names and addresses of any witnesses and persons seeking “damages”; and

   b. What claim you think may result.

   However, even when you notify us of a “professional incident”, this does not relieve you of your obligation to also notify us of any resulting claim or “suit”.

2. If a claim is made or “suit” is brought against any insured, you must:

   a. Immediately record the specifics of the claim or “suit” and the date received; and  
   b. Notify us as soon as practicable.  
   
   You must see to it that we receive written notice of the claim or “suit” as soon as practicable.

3. You and any other involved insured must:

   a. Immediately send us copies of any demands, notices, summonses or legal papers received in connection with the claim or “suit”;
   b. Authorize us to obtain records and other information;
   c. Cooperate with us in the investigation, settlement or defense of the claim or “suit”;
   d. Assist us, upon our request, in the enforcement of any right against any person or organization which may be liable to the insured because of injury or damage to which this insurance may also apply; and
   e. In no way jeopardize our rights after a “professional incident”.

4. No insureds will, except at their own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.

### D. Legal Action Against Us

No person or organization has a right under this Coverage Part:

1. To join us as a party or otherwise bring us into a “suit” asking for “damages” from an insured; or
2. To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of its terms have been fully complied with.

A person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed settlement or on a final judgment against an insured obtained after an actual trial; but we will not be liable for “damages” that are not payable under the terms of this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the applicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability signed by us, the insured and the claimant or the claimant’s legal representative.

### E. Other Insurance

If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under this Coverage Part, our obligations are limited as follows:

1. **Primary Insurance**

   This insurance is primary except when 2. below applies. If this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in 3. below.

2. **Excess Insurance**

   This insurance is excess over any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis if:

   a. Your “employee” or volunteer has other insurance covering his or her professional liability.

# PI-HS-003 (07/04)

**Premiums are due and payable on notice to the**

b. You have purchased insurance from a first Named Insured. If the sum of the advance and audit premiums paid for the policy period is greater than the earned premium, we will return the excess to the first Named Insured.

When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty to defend any claim or “suit” that any other insurer has a duty to defend. If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the insured’s rights against all those other insurers.

When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of:

a. The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance; and

b. The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance.

We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part.

## 3. Method of Sharing

If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first.

If the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will continue by limits. Under this method, each insurer’s share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.

## F. Premium Audit

1. We will compute all premiums for this Coverage Part in accordance with our rules and rates.

2. Premium shown in this Coverage Part as advance premium is a deposit premium only. At the close of each audit period we have the right to compute the earned premium for that period. Audit premiums are due and payable on notice to the first Named Insured. If the sum of the advance and audit premiums paid for the policy period is greater than the earned premium, we will return the excess to the first Named Insured.

3. The first Named Insured must keep records of the information we need for premium computation, and send us copies at such times as we may request.

## G. Representations

By accepting this policy, you agree:

1. The statements in the Declarations are accurate and complete;

2. Those statements are based upon representations you made to us; and

3. We have issued this policy in reliance upon your representations.

## H. Separation Of Insureds

Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this Coverage Part to the first Named Insured, this insurance applies:

1. As if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured; and

2. Separately to each insured against whom claim is made or “suit” is brought.

## I. Transfer of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us

If the insured has rights to recover all or part of any payment we have made under this Coverage Part, those rights are transferred to us. The insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. At our request, the insured will bring “suit” or transfer those rights to us and help us enforce them.

## J. Governmental Immunity

If you are a public institution, you may be entitled to Governmental Immunity. This Coverage Part does not constitute a waiver of any charitable or governmental immunity to which you are entitled.

## K. Settlement

If the first Named Insured refuses to consent, within a

reasonable period of time, to any settlement offer we recommend and elects to contest the claim or continue any legal proceedings in connection with such claim then, subject to the provisions of **SECTION III – LIMITS OF INSURANCE**, our liability for the claim will not exceed the amount for which the claim could have been settled, plus the cost of defense incurred by us up to the date of such refusal.

### L. Two or More Coverage Parts Or Policies Issued By Us

It is our stated intention that the various coverage parts or policy issued to you by us, or any company affiliated with us, do not provide any duplication or overlap of coverage for the same claim or “suit”. If this policy and any other coverage part or policy issued to you by us, or any company affiliated with us, apply to the same “professional incident”, occurrence, offense, wrongful act, accident or loss, the maximum Limit of Insurance under all such coverage parts or policies combined shall not exceed the highest applicable Limit of Insurance under any one coverage part or policy.

This condition does not apply to any Excess or Umbrella Policy issued by us specifically to apply as excess insurance over this policy.

### M. When We Do Not Renew

If we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we will mail or deliver to the first Named Insured shown in the Declarations written notice of the nonrenewal not less than 30 days before the expiration date. If notice is mailed, proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice.
