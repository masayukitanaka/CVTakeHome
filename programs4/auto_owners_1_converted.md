# NOTICE TO POLICYHOLDER

## TENTATIVE PROPERTY RATE

Dear Policyholder:

A tentative property rate was used to develop the property premium for your policy. A property rate, developed by the Insurance Services Office (ISO) in your state, is currently not available for your covered property.

Once developed, the new property rate will be applied as of the inception of the current policy term or the date the property was added to the policy if the adjustment will decrease your premium. If the adjustment will increase your premium, it will be applied at the next renewal. Please refer to the enclosed endorsement titled **Tentative Rate**.

This notice is for informational purposes only. Your policy contains the specific terms and conditions of coverage.

If you have any questions regarding your policy or this notice, please contact your Auto-Owners agent.

# NOTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE CHANGES IN COVERAGE FOR TERRORISM

Dear Policyholder:

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) will expire on December 31, 2027 unless the Federal government extends the Act. What this means to you is the following:

1. Subject to policy terms and conditions, the enclosed policy will provide insurance coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined in the Act only until December 31, 2027.

2. A conditional endorsement entitled, **Conditional Exclusion Of Terrorism Involving Nuclear, Biological Or Chemical Terrorism (Relating To Disposition Of Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act)** is enclosed. This conditional endorsement will only apply if the Act is not extended or if the Act is revised to increase statutory deductibles, decrease the federal government's share in potential losses above the statutory deductibles, change the levels, terms or conditions of coverage and we are no longer required to make terrorism coverage available and elect not to do so. It will not apply if the Act is simply extended.

3. The conditional endorsement will provide coverage for an incident of terrorism pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy only if the incident does not involve nuclear, biological or chemical material.

4. A premium charge for the conditional endorsement will be applied effective January 1, 2028. The premium will be pro-rated for the remainder of the policy term and is one-half of the current premium charge appearing in the Declarations for **TERRORISM - CERTIFIED ACTS**. However, it will only be made if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) is not extended. Revised Declarations will be mailed to you after January 1, 2028.

5. If the Act is extended without any revision, the enclosed policy will continue to provide coverage for certified acts of terrorism. The conditional endorsement will not be activated and the changes in coverage or premium referenced above will not apply.

6. If the Act is extended with revisions or is replaced, and we are required or elect to continue to offer coverage for certified acts of terrorism, we may amend this policy in accordance with the provisions of the revised Act or its replacement.

This notice is for informational purposes only.

If you have any questions concerning your policy or this notice, please contact your Auto-Owners agency.

# OWNERS INSURANCE COMPANY

## NOTICE CONCERNING POLICYHOLDER RIGHTS IN AN INSOLVENCY UNDER THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION LAW

The financial strength of your insurer is one of the most important things for you to consider when determining from whom to purchase a property or liability insurance policy. It is your best assurance that you will receive the protection for which you purchased the policy. If your insurer becomes insolvent, you may have protection from the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association as described below but to the extent that your policy is not protected by the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association or if it exceeds the guaranty association's limits, you will only have the assets, if any, of the insolvent insurer to satisfy your claim.

Residents of Minnesota who purchase property and casualty or liability insurance from insurance companies licensed to do business in Minnesota are protected, **SUBJECT TO LIMITS AND EXCLUSIONS**, in the event the insurer becomes insolvent. This protection is provided by the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association.

### Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association

7600 Parklawn Avenue  
Edina, Minnesota 55435-5137  
(952) 831-1908

The maximum amount that the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association will pay in regard to a claim under all policies issued by the same insurer is limited to $300,000. This limit does not apply to workers' compensation insurance. Protection by the guaranty association is subject to other substantial limitations and exclusions. If your claim exceeds the guaranty association's limits, you may still recover a part or all of that amount from the proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvent insurer, if any exist. Funds to pay claims may not be immediately available. The guaranty association assesses insurers licensed to sell property and casualty or liability insurance in Minnesota after the insolvency occurs. Claims are paid from the assessment.

**THE PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR USING CARE IN SELECTING INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE WELL MANAGED AND FINANCIALLY STABLE. IN SELECTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY OR POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON PROTECTION BY THE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION.**

**THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED BY MINNESOTA STATE LAW TO ADVISE POLICYHOLDERS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES OF THEIR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT THEIR INSURANCE CARRIER BECOMES INSOLVENT. THIS NOTICE IN NO WAY IMPLIES THAT THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. ALL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THIS NOTICE.**

Policy Number `234606-08729990`

In the endorsement. If no applicable Deductible is shown in the Schedule for a coverage, the policy Deductible shown in the Declarations will apply to such coverage unless otherwise stated.

In any one occurrence of loss or damage (hereinafter referred to as loss), the Deductible will apply as follows:

1. **Multiple Deductibles** may apply to a loss.  
   However, if multiple types of Covered Property are involved in a loss and different Deductibles are shown in the Schedule for the different types of Covered Property, only the largest applicable Deductible for each coverage will apply.  
   When a Deductible in the Schedule applies to a Business Income or Extra Expense loss, such Deductible applies in place of any waiting period set forth in the BUSINESS INCOME form attached to this policy.

2. If the adjusted amount of loss is less than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for that loss. If the adjusted amount of loss exceeds the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deductible from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

3. The Schedule may indicate Direct Coverages Deductibles and Indirect Coverages Deductibles. Unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule, Indirect Coverages Deductibles apply to Business Income loss and Extra Expense loss and Direct Coverages Deductibles apply to all other loss.

4. When a **Dollar Deductible** is shown in the Schedule, we will subtract the Deductible amount from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

5. When a **Time Deductible** is shown in the Schedule, we will not pay for loss that occurs during the specified time period immediately following the "Equipment Breakdown" occurrence. If the Time Deductible is expressed as a number of days, each day means twenty-four consecutive hours.

6. When a **Multiple of ADV Deductible** is shown in the Schedule, the amount of Deductible will be calculated as follows:

   a. Take the amount of Business Income that you would have earned during the "period of restoration" had no "Equipment Breakdown" loss occurred (Business Income and "period of restoration" have the meanings set forth in the BUSINESS INCOME form attached to this policy). The Business Income will include the entire location regardless of the loss affecting the entire location or part of the location. If two or more locations are affected in the "Equipment Breakdown" loss, the Business Income will be the combined amount of all affected locations.

   b. Take the result in paragraph 6.a. and divide it by the number of days your business would have been operating during the "period of restoration" had no "Equipment Breakdown" occurred. This result is the Average Daily Value.

   c. The Average Daily Value calculated in paragraph 6.b. multiplied by the number shown in the Schedule is the amount of the Multiple of ADV Deductible. We will subtract this amount from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

f. **F. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS** is amended. The following Conditions are added for purposes of this endorsement only.

   (1) **Suspension**  
   Whenever Covered Property is found to be in, or exposed to, a dangerous condition, any of our representatives may immediately suspend the insurance against loss to that Covered Property for the perils covered by this endorsement. Coverage can be suspended and possibly reinstated by delivering or mailing a written notice of suspension or coverage reinstatement to:  
   (a) Your last known address; or

This condition does not apply to any property to which Actual Cash Value applies.

### (5) Other Insurance Issued By Us

If this policy provides coverage for Data Processing Equipment Coverages, Electronic Data Processing Equipment, Refrigerated Products, Spoilage or Mechanical Breakdown where two or more of this policy's coverages apply to the same loss or damage, the coverage of this endorsement shall supersede any coverages provided outside of this Equipment Breakdown Endorsement for the loss or damage that arises out of an "Equipment Breakdown" loss.

of Insurance applicable to the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage.

(b) Subject to (a) above, the amount we will pay for debris removal expense is limited to 25% of the sum of the deductible plus the amount that we pay for direct physical loss or damage to the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage.

(4) We will pay up to an additional $10,000 for debris removal expense, for each location, in any one occurrence of physical loss or damage to Covered Property, if one or both of the following circumstances apply:

- (a) The total of the actual debris removal expense plus the amount we pay for direct physical loss or damage exceeds the Limit of Insurance on the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage.
- (b) The actual debris removal expense exceeds 25% of the sum of the deductible plus the amount that we pay for direct physical loss or damage to the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage.

Therefore, if (4)(a) and/or (4)(b) apply, our total payment for direct physical loss or damage and debris removal expense may reach but will never exceed the Limit of Insurance on the Covered Property that has sustained loss or damage, plus $10,000.

### (5) Examples

In the following examples, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance. The following examples assume that there is no Coinsurance penalty.

#### EXAMPLE #1

- **Limit of Insurance:** $90,000
- **Amount of Deductible:** $500
- **Amount of Loss:** $50,000
- **Amount of Loss Payable:** $49,500 ($50,000 - $500)
- **Debris Removal Expense:** $10,000
- **Debris Removal Expense Payable:** $10,000 ($10,000 is 20% of $50,000.)

The debris removal expense is less than 25% of the sum of the loss payable plus the deductible. The sum of the loss payable and the debris removal expense ($49,500 + $10,000 = $59,500) is less than the Limit of Insurance. Therefore, the full amount of debris removal expense is payable in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (3).

#### EXAMPLE #2

- **Limit of Insurance:** $90,000
- **Amount of Deductible:** $500
- **Amount of Loss:** $80,000
- **Amount of Loss Payable:** $79,500 ($80,000 - $500)
- **Debris Removal Expense:** $30,000
- **Debris Removal Expense Payable:**
  - **Basic Amount:** $10,500
  - **Additional Amount:** $10,000

The basic amount payable for debris removal expense under the terms of Paragraph (3) is calculated as follows: $80,000 ($79,500 + $500) x .25 = $20,000; capped at $10,500. The cap applies because the sum of the loss payable ($79,500) and the basic amount payable for debris removal expense ($10,500) cannot exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000).

The additional amount payable for debris removal expense is provided in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (4), because the debris removal expense ($30,000) exceeds 25% of the loss payable plus the deductible ($30,000 is 37.5% of $80,000), and because the sum of the loss payable and debris removal expense ($79,500 + $30,000 = $109,500) would exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000). The additional amount of covered debris removal expense is $10,000, the maximum payable under Paragraph (4). Thus, the total payable for debris removal expense in this example is $20,500; $9,500 of the debris removal expense is not covered.

### b. Preservation Of Property

If it is necessary to move Covered Property from the described premises to preserve it from loss or damage by a Covered Cause of Loss, we will pay for any direct physical loss or damage to that property:

1. While it is being moved or while temporarily stored at another location; and
2. Only if the loss or damage occurs within 45 days, unless a higher number of days are shown in the Declarations, after the property is first moved.

This Additional Coverage does not apply to costs to test for, monitor or assess the existence, concentration or effects of "pollutants". However, we will pay for testing which is performed in the course of extracting the "pollutants" from the land or water.

The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage for each described premises is **$10,000**, unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations, for the sum of all covered expenses arising out of Covered Causes of Loss occurring during each separate **12-month** period of this policy.

1. Subject to the provisions of this Additional Coverage, we will pay for the cost to replace or restore "electronic data" which has been destroyed or corrupted by a Covered Cause of Loss.

3. **Limit of Insurance**

   - **(a) Annual Aggregate Limit** – The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage, Electronic Data, for all loss or damage sustained in any one policy year, regardless of the number of occurrences of loss or damage or the number of premises, locations or computer systems involved is **$10,000**, unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations.

      2. The period of time you have been in business as of the date the loss or damage occurs.

### D. DEDUCTIBLE

The applicable Deductible shown in the Declarations will apply unless otherwise stated by endorsement.

In any one occurrence of loss or damage (hereinafter referred to as loss), the Deductible will apply as follows:

1. We will first reduce the amount of loss if required by the Coinsurance Condition or the Agreed Value Optional Coverage.
   
   a. If the adjusted amount of loss is less than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for that loss.
   
   b. If the adjusted amount of loss exceeds the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deductible from the adjusted amount of loss and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

2. If Paragraph 1., above does not apply:
   
   a. If the amount of loss is less than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for that loss.
   
   b. If the amount of loss exceeds the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deductible from the loss and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

When the occurrence involves loss to more than one item of Covered Property and separate Limits of Insurance apply, the losses will not be combined in determining application of the Deductible. However, the Deductible will be applied only once per occurrence.

3. No Deductible applies to the following Additional Coverages:
   
   a. Fire Department Service Charge;  
   b. Fire Extinguisher Systems Recharge Expense;  
   c. Arson Reward;  
   d. Theft Reward; and  
   e. Rekeying of Locks.

In the following examples, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance.

The following examples assume there is no Coinsurance penalty.

#### EXAMPLE #1

- **Deductible:** $250  
- **Limit of Insurance - Building #1:** $60,000  
- **Limit of Insurance - Building #2:** $80,000  
- **Loss to Building #1:** $60,100  
- **Loss to Building #2:** $90,000  

The amount of loss to Building #1 ($60,100) is less than the sum ($60,250) of the Limit of Insurance applicable to Building #1 plus the Deductible.

The Deductible will be subtracted from the amount of loss in calculating the loss payable for Building #1:

```
$60,100
- 250
$59,850 Loss Payable - Building #1
```

The Deductible applies once per occurrence and therefore is not subtracted in determining the amount of loss payable for Building #2. Loss payable for Building #2 is the Limit of Insurance of $80,000.

**Total amount of loss payable:**  
$59,850 + $80,000 = $139,850

### EXAMPLE #2

The Deductible and Limits of Insurance are the same as those in Example #1.

- **Loss to Building #1:** $70,000  
  (Exceeds Limit of Insurance plus Deductible)
- **Loss to Building #2:** $90,000  
  (Exceeds Limit of Insurance plus Deductible)
- **Loss Payable – Building #1:** $60,000  
  (Limit of Insurance)
- **Loss Payable - Building #2:** $80,000  
  (Limit of Insurance)

**Total amount of loss payable:** $140,000

## E. LOSS CONDITIONS

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

### 1. Abandonment

There can be no abandonment of any property to us.

### 2. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

- a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and

   4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for any subsequent loss or damage resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.
   5. At our request, give us complete inventories of the damaged and undamaged property. Include quantities, costs, values and amount of loss claimed.
   6. As often as may be reasonably required, permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records. Also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection, testing and analysis, and permit us to make copies from your books and records.
   7. Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss containing the information we request to investigate the claim. You must do this within 60 days after our request. We will supply you with the necessary forms.
   8. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.

b. We may examine any insured under oath, while not in the presence of any other insured and at such times as may be reasonably required, about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim, including an insured's books and records.

- We will determine the value of lost or damaged property, or the cost of its repair or replacement, in accordance with the applicable terms of the **Valuation Condition** in this Coverage Form or any applicable provision which amends or supersedes the Valuation Condition.

#### h. Party Wall

- A party wall is a wall that separates and is common to adjoining buildings that are owned by different parties. In settling covered losses involving a party wall, we will pay a proportion of the loss to the party wall based on your interest in the wall in proportion to the interest of the owner of the adjoining building. However, if you elect to repair or replace your building and the owner of the adjoining building elects not to repair or replace that building, we will pay you the full value of the loss to the party wall, subject to all applicable policy provisions including Limits of Insurance, the Valuation and Coinsurance Conditions, and all other provisions of this Loss Payment Condition. Our payment under the provisions of this paragraph does not alter any right of subrogation we may have against any entity, including the owner or insurer of the adjoining building, and does not alter the terms of the **Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us Condition** in this policy.

### 5. Recovered Property

- If either you or we recover any property after loss settlement, that party must give the other prompt notice.
- If you recover the property, at your option, you may retain the property. You must then return to us the amount we paid to you for the property less any expenses to repair the Covered Property and expenses incurred to recover the property. You may give us the recovered property in which case we will pay recovery expenses, subject to the Limit of Insurance.
- If we recover the property, at your option, we may return the property to you. We will pay any recovery expenses, subject to the Limit of Insurance. We will also pay any expenses to repair the Covered Property, subject to the Limit of Insurance.

Buildings under construction or renovation are not considered vacant.

#### Vacancy Provisions

If the building where loss or damage occurs has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days before that loss or damage occurs:

1. We will not pay for any loss or damage caused by any of the following even if they are Covered Causes of Loss:
   - **Vandalism**
   - **Sprinkler leakage**, unless you have protected the system against freezing
   - **Building glass breakage**
   - **Water damage**
   - **Theft**
   - **Attempted theft**

2. With respect to Covered Causes of Loss other than those listed in b.(1)(a) through b.(1)(f) above, we will reduce the amount we would otherwise pay for the loss or damage by 15%.

### Valuation

We will determine the value of Covered Property in the event of loss or damage as follows:

- At actual cash value as of the time of loss or damage, except as provided in b., c., d., and e. below.
- If the Limit of Insurance for Building satisfies the Additional Condition, Coinsurance, and the cost to repair or replace the damaged building property is $2,500 or less, we will pay the cost of building repairs or replacement.

The cost of building repairs or replacement does not include the increased cost attributable to enforcement of any ordinance or law regulating the construction, use, or repair of any property.

However, the following property will be valued at the actual cash value even when attached to the building:

- Awnings or floor coverings
- Appliances for refrigerating, ventilating, cooking, dishwashing, or laundering
- Outdoor equipment or furniture

- "Stock" you have sold but not delivered at the selling price less discounts and expenses you otherwise would have had.
- Glass at the cost of replacement with safety-glazing material if required by law.
- Tenants' Improvements and Betterments at:
  1. Actual cash value of the lost or damaged property if you make repairs promptly.
  2. A proportion of your original cost if you do not make repairs promptly. We will determine the proportionate value as follows:
     - Multiply the original cost by the number of days from the loss or damage to the expiration of the lease; and
     - Divide the amount determined in (a) above by the number of days from the installation of improvements to the expiration of the lease.

If your lease contains a renewal option, the expiration of the renewal option period will replace the expiration of the lease in the procedure.

3. Nothing if others pay for repairs or replacement.

### Additional Conditions

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

#### Coinsurance

If a Coinsurance percentage is shown in the Declarations, the following condition applies:

- We will not pay the full amount of any loss if the value of Covered Property at the time of loss times the Coinsurance percentage shown for it in the Declarations is greater than the Limit of Insurance for the property.

Instead, we will determine the most we will pay using the following steps:

1. Multiply the value of Covered Property at the time of loss by the Coinsurance percentage;
2. Divide the Limit of Insurance of the property by the figure determined in Step (1);
3. Multiply the total amount of loss, before the application of any deductible, by the figure determined in Step (2); and
4. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in Step (3).

We will pay the amount determined in Step (4) or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less. For the remainder, you will either have to rely on other insurance or absorb the loss yourself.

In the following examples, the figures used are for Building at Location #2: $30,000 illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance. Personal Property at Location #2: $20,000

$50,000

### EXAMPLE #1 (UNDERINSURANCE)

- **Step (1):** $250,000 x 90% = $225,000  
  When: The value of the property is: $250,000  
  The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 80%  
  The Limit of Insurance for it is: $100,000  
  The Deductible is: $250  
  The amount of loss is: $40,000  

- **Step (2):** $180,000 ÷ $225,000 = .80

- **Step (3):** $50,000 x .80 = $40,000

- **Step (4):** $40,000 - $1,000 = $39,000

  We will pay no more than $39,000. The remaining $11,000 is not covered.

- **Step (1):** $250,000 x 80% = $200,000  
  (the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Co-insurance requirements)

- **Step (2):** $100,000 ÷ $200,000 = .50

- **Step (3):** $40,000 x .50 = $20,000

- **Step (4):** $20,000 - $250 = $19,750

  We will pay no more than $19,750. The remaining $20,250 is not covered.

### 2. Mortgageholders

a. The term mortgageholder includes trustee.

b. We will pay for covered loss of or damage to buildings or structures to each mortgageholder shown in the Declarations in their order of precedence, as interests may appear.

c. The mortgageholder has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgageholder has started foreclosure or similar action on the building or structure.

d. If we deny your claim because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part, the mortgageholder will still have the right to receive loss payment if the mortgageholder:

   1. Pays any premium due under this Coverage Part at our request if you have failed to do so;
   2. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so; and
   3. Has notified us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk known to the mortgageholder.

   All of the terms of this Coverage Part will then apply directly to the mortgageholder.

e. If we pay the mortgageholder for any loss or damage and deny payment to you because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part:

   1. The mortgageholder's rights under the mortgage will be transferred to us to the extent of the amount we pay; and
   2. The mortgageholder's right to recover the full amount of the mortgageholder's claim will not be impaired.

   At our option, we may pay to the mortgageholder the whole principal on the mortgage.

### EXAMPLE #2 (ADEQUATE INSURANCE)

- When: The value of the property is: $250,000  
  The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 80%  
  The Limit of Insurance for it is: $200,000  
  The Deductible is: $250  
  The amount of loss is: $40,000  

  The minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($250,000 x 80%). Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this example is adequate and no penalty applies. We will pay no more than $39,750 ($40,000 amount of loss minus the deductible of $250).

b. If one Limit of Insurance applies to two or more separate items, this condition will apply to the total of all property to which the limit applies.

### EXAMPLE #3

- When: The value of the property is:  
  Building at Location #1: $75,000  
  Building at Location #2: $100,000  
  Personal Property at Location #2: $75,000  
  $250,000  

  The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 90%  
  The Limit of Insurance for Buildings and Personal Property at Locations #1 and #2 is: $180,000  
  The Deductible is: $1,000  
  The amount of loss is:

plus any accrued interest. In this event, your mortgage and note will be transferred to us and you will pay your remaining mortgage debt to us.

f. If we cancel this policy, we will give written notice to the mortgageholder at least:  
   (1) 10 days before the effective date of cancellation if we cancel for your non-payment of premium; or  
   (2) 30 days before the effective date of cancellation if we cancel for any other reason.

g. If we elect not to renew this policy, we will give written notice to the mortgageholder at least 10 days before the expiration date of this policy.

## G. OPTIONAL COVERAGES

If shown as applicable in the Declarations, the following Optional Coverages apply separately to each item.

1. **Agreed Value**  
   a. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to Covered Property to which this Optional Coverage applies. We will pay no more for loss of or damage to that property than the proportion that the Limit of Insurance under this Coverage Part for the property bears to the Agreed Value shown for it in the Declarations.  
   b. If the expiration date for this Optional Coverage shown in the Declarations is not extended, the Additional Condition, Coinsurance, is reinstated and this Optional Coverage expires.  
   c. The terms of this Optional Coverage apply only to loss or damage that occurs:  
      (1) On or after the effective date of this Optional Coverage; and  
      (2) Before the Agreed Value expiration date shown in the Declarations or the policy expiration date, whichever occurs first.

2. **Inflation Guard**  
   a. The Limit of Insurance for property to which this Optional Coverage applied will automatically increase by the annual percentage shown in the Declarations.  
   b. The amount of increase will be:  
      (1) The Limit of Insurance that applied on the most recent of the policy inception date, the policy anniversary date, or any other policy change amending the Limit of Insurance, times  
      (2) The percentage of annual increase shown in the Declarations, expressed as a decimal (example: 8% is .08), times  
      (3) The number of days since the beginning of the current policy year or the effective date of the most recent policy change amending the Limit of Insurance, divided by 365.

   In the following example, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance.

   **EXAMPLE**  
   If:  
   - The applicable Limit of Insurance is: $100,000  
   - The annual percentage increase is: 8%  
   - The number of days since the beginning of the policy year (or last policy change) is: 146  
   - The amount of increase is:  
     ```
     $100,000 x .08 x 146 ÷ 365 = $3,200
     ```

3. **Replacement Cost**  
   a. Replacement Cost (without deduction for depreciation) replaces Actual Cash Value in the Valuation Loss Condition of this Coverage Form.  
   b. This Optional Coverage does not apply to:  
      (1) Personal property of others;  
      (2) Contents of a residence;

      (4) "Stock", unless the Including "Stock" option is shown in the Declarations.

   Under the terms of this Replacement Cost Optional Coverage, tenants' improvements and betterments are not considered to be the personal property of others.

   c. You may make a claim for loss or damage covered by this insurance on an actual cash value basis instead of on a replacement cost basis. In the event you elect to have loss or damage settled on an actual cash value basis, you may still make a claim for the additional coverage this Optional Coverage provides if you notify us of your intent to do so within 180 days after the loss or damage.  
   d. We will not pay on a replacement cost basis for any loss or damage:  
      (1) Until the lost or damaged property is actually repaired or replaced; and  
      (2) Unless the repairs or replacement are made as soon as reasonably possible after the loss or damage.

   With respect to tenants' improvements and betterments, the following also apply:

1. **Extended Business Income**
   - **Business Income Other Than "Rental Value"**
     - If the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" produces a Business Income loss payable under this policy, we will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you incur during the period that:

   - However, Extended Business Income does not apply to loss of Business Income incurred as a result of unfavorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss in the area where the described premises are located.

   - Loss of Business Income must be caused by direct physical loss or damage at the described premises caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.

     - (b) Ends on the earlier of:
       1. The date you could restore tenant occupancy, with reasonable speed, to the level which would generate the "Rental Value" that would have existed if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred; or

   - However, Extended Business Income does not apply to loss of "Rental Value" incurred as a result of unfavorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss in the area where the described premises are located.

Agency Code `06-0883-00`  
Policy Number `234606-08729990`

introduced into or enacted on a computer system (including "electronic data") or a network to which it is connected, designed to damage or destroy any part of the system or disrupt its normal operation. However, there is no coverage for an interruption related to manipulation of a computer system (including "electronic data") by any employee, including a temporary or leased employee, or by an entity retained by you or for you to inspect, design, install, maintain, repair or replace that system.

(3) The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations for all loss sustained and expense incurred in any one policy year, regardless of the number of interruptions or the number of premises, locations or computer systems involved is **$10,000**, unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations, subject to the following:

- (a) If at the time of interruption, the computer system is equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, this entire amount is available.
- (b) If at the time of interruption, the computer system is not equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, payment will be limited to **$2,500** for that occurrence.

If loss payment relating to the first interruption does not exhaust this amount, then the balance is available for loss or expense sustained or incurred as a result of subsequent interruptions in that policy year. A balance remaining at the end of a policy year does not increase the amount of insurance in the next policy year. With respect to any interruption which begins in one policy year and continues or results in additional loss or expense in a subsequent policy year(s), all loss and expense is deemed to be sustained or incurred in the policy year in which the interruption began.

(4) This Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations does not apply to loss sustained or expense incurred after the end of the "period of restoration", even if the amount of insurance stated in (3) above has not been exhausted.

### 6. Coverage Extension

If a Coinsurance percentage of 50% or more is shown in the Declarations, you may extend the insurance provided by this Coverage Part as follows:

   2. Use as a warehouse.

b. The most we will pay under this Extension, for the sum of Business Income loss and Extra Expense incurred, is **$100,000** at each location.

c. Insurance under this Extension for each newly acquired location will end when any of the following first occurs:

   1. This policy expires;
   2. 60 days expire after you acquire or begin to construct the property; or
   3. You report values to us.

We will charge you additional premium for values reported from the date you acquire the property. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to this Extension.

#### 1. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the amount of Net Income and operating expense or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser.

The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the amount of Net Income and operating expense or amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

- a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
- b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

#### 2. Duties In The Event Of Loss

a. You must see that the following are done in the event of loss:

   1. Notify the police if a law may have been broken.
   2. Give us prompt notice of the direct physical loss or damage. Include a description of the property involved.
   3. As soon as possible, give us a description of how, when, and where the direct physical loss or damage occurred.
   4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for any subsequent loss or damage resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.
   5. As often as may be reasonably required, permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records. Also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection, testing and analysis, and permit us to make copies from your books and records.
   6. Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss containing the information we request to investigate the claim. You must do this within 60 days after our request. We will supply you with the necessary forms.
   7. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.
   8. If you intend to continue your business, you must resume all or part of your "operations" as quickly as possible.

b. We may examine any insured under oath, while not in the presence of any other insured and at such times as may be reasonably required, about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim, including an insured's books and records. In the event of an examination, an insured's answers must be signed.

#### 3. Loss Determination

a. The amount of Business Income loss will be determined based on:

   1. The Net Income of the business before the direct physical loss or damage occurred;
   2. The likely Net Income of the business if no physical loss or damage had occurred, but not including any Net Income that would likely have been earned as a result of an increase in the volume of business due to favorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss on customers or on other businesses;
   3. The operating expenses, including payroll expenses, necessary to resume "operations" with the same quality of service that existed just before the direct physical loss or damage; and

### (4) Other relevant sources of information

b. An appraisal award has been made.

#### D. ADDITIONAL CONDITION

**COINSURANCE**

If a Coinsurance percentage is shown in the Declarations, the following condition applies in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

b. The amount of Extra Expense will be determined based on:

1. All expenses that exceed the normal operating expenses that would have been incurred by "operations" during the "period of restoration" if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred. We will deduct from the total of such expenses:
   - (a) The salvage value that remains of any property bought for temporary use during the "period of restoration" once "operations" are resumed; and
   - (b) Any Extra Expense that is paid for by other insurance, except for insurance that is written subject to the same plan, terms, conditions and provisions as this insurance; and

2. Necessary expenses that reduce the Business Income loss that otherwise would have been incurred.

#### c. Resumption Of Operations

We will reduce the amount of your:

1. Business Income loss, other than Extra Expense, to the extent you can resume your "operations", in whole or in part, by using damaged or undamaged property (including merchandise or stock) at the described premises or elsewhere.

2. Extra Expense loss to the extent you can return "operations" to normal and discontinue such Extra Expense.

d. If you do not resume "operations", or do not resume "operations" as quickly as possible, we will pay based on the length of time it would have taken to resume "operations" as quickly as possible.

### 4. Loss Payment

We will pay for covered loss within 30 days after we receive the sworn proof of loss, if you have complied with all of the terms of this Coverage Part and:

a. We have reached agreement with you on the amount of loss; or

### Coinsurance Calculation

We will not pay the full amount of any Business Income loss if the Limit of Insurance for Business Income is less than:

1. The Coinsurance percentage shown for Business Income in the Declarations; times
2. The sum of:
   - a. The Net Income (Net Profit or Loss before income taxes), and
   - b. Operating expenses, including payroll expenses that would have been earned or incurred (had no loss occurred) by your "operations" at the described premises for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy (whichever is later).

Instead, we will determine the most we will pay using the following steps:

- **Step(1):** Multiply the Net Income and operating expense for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy by the Coinsurance percentage;
- **Step(2):** Divide the Limit of Insurance for the described premises by the figure determined in Step (1); and
- **Step(3):** Multiply the total amount of loss by the figure determined in Step (2).

We will pay the amount determined in Step (3) or the limit of insurance, whichever is less. For the remainder, you will either have to rely on other insurance or absorb the loss yourself.

In determining operating expenses for the purpose of applying the Coinsurance condition, the following expenses, if applicable, shall be deducted from the total of all operating expenses:

1. Prepaid freight - outgoing;
2. Returns and allowances;
3. Discounts;
4. Bad debts;
5. Collection expenses;

## Important Requirements

1. **Cost of raw stock and factory supplies consumed** (including transportation charges); Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this example is adequate and no penalty applies. We will pay no more than $80,000 (amount of loss).

2. **Cost of merchandise sold** (including transportation charges);

3. **Cost of other supplies consumed** (including transportation charges);

4. **Cost of services purchased from outsiders** (not employees) to resell, that do not continue under contract;

5. **Power, heat and refrigeration expenses** that do not continue under contract (if `Form CP 15 11` is attached);

6. **All ordinary payroll expenses or the amount of payroll expense excluded** (if `Form CP 15 10` is attached); and

7. **Special deductions for mining properties** (royalties unless specifically included in coverage; actual depletion commonly known as unit or cost depletion - not percentage depletion; welfare and retirement fund charges based on tonnage; hired trucks).

In the following examples, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance.

### Example #1 (Underinsurance)

- **When:** The Net Income and operating expenses for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy at the described premises would have been: **$400,000**
- **The Coinsurance percentage is:** **50%**
- **The Limit of Insurance is:** **$150,000**
- **The amount of loss is:** **$80,000**

**Step (1):** $400,000 x 50% = $200,000 (the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirements)

**Step (2):** $150,000 ÷ $200,000 = .75

**Step (3):** $80,000 x .75 = $60,000

We will pay no more than $60,000. The remaining $20,000 is not covered.

### Example #2 (Adequate Insurance)

- **When:** The Net Income and operating expenses for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy at the described premises would have been: **$400,000**
- **The Coinsurance percentage is:** **50%**
- **The Limit of Insurance is:** **$200,000**
- **The amount of loss is:** **$80,000**

The minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($400,000 x 50%).

# BUSINESS INCOME (AND EXTRA EXPENSE)  
## ACTUAL LOSS SUSTAINED COVERAGE FORM

Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, duties, and what is and is not covered.

Throughout this policy, the words "you" and "your" refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations. The words "we", "us", and "our" refer to the Company providing this insurance. Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Section C., DEFINITIONS.

The descriptions in the headings of this Coverage Form and all applicable endorsements are solely for convenience and form no part of the terms and conditions of coverage.

### A. COVERAGE

#### 1. Business Income

a. **Business Income** means the:

   1. Net Income (Net Profit or Loss before income taxes) that would have been earned or incurred; and
   2. Continuing normal operating expenses incurred, including payroll.

   For manufacturing risks, Net Income includes the net sales value of production.

b. We will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you sustain due to the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" during the "period of restoration". The "suspension" must be caused by direct physical loss of or damage to property at premises which are described in the Declarations and for which ACTUAL LOSS SUSTAINED is shown in the Declarations. The loss or damage must be caused by or result from a Covered Cause of Loss. With respect to loss of or damage to personal property in the open or personal property in a vehicle, the described premises include the area within 1,000 feet of the site at which the described premises are located.

   With respect to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph, if you occupy only part of the site at which the described premises are located, your premises means:

   1. The portion of the building which you rent, lease or occupy; and
   2. Any area within the building or on the site at which the described premises are located, if that area services, or is used to gain access to, the described premises.

c. We will only pay for loss of Business Income that you sustain during the "period of restoration" and that occurs within the number of months shown in the Declarations after the date of direct physical loss or damage.

#### 2. Extra Expense

a. **Extra Expense Coverage** is provided at the premises described in the Declarations only if the Declarations show that Business Income Coverage applies at that premises.

b. **Extra Expense** means necessary expenses you incur during the "period of restoration" that you would not have incurred if there had been no direct physical loss or damage to property caused by or resulting from a Covered Cause of Loss.

   We will pay Extra Expense (other than the expense to repair or replace property) to:

   1. Avoid or minimize the "suspension" of business and to continue operations at the described premises or at replacement premises or temporary locations, including relocation expenses and costs to equip and operate the replacement location or temporary location.
   2. Minimize the "suspension" of business if you cannot continue "operations".

   We will also pay Extra Expense to repair or replace property, but only to the extent it reduces the amount of loss that otherwise would have been payable under this Coverage Form.

   We will only pay for Extra Expense that occurs within the number of months shown in the Declarations after the date of direct physical loss or damage.

### 3. Covered Causes Of Loss, Exclusions And Limitations

See applicable Causes Of Loss Form as shown in the Declarations. Civil Authority Coverage for Business Income will apply for a period of up to four consecutive weeks from the date on which such coverage began.

### 4. Additional Limitation - Interruption Of Computer Operations

a. Coverage for Business Income does not apply when a "suspension" of "operations" is caused by destruction or corruption of "electronic data", or any loss or damage to "electronic data", except as provided under the Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations.

b. Coverage for Extra Expense does not apply when action is taken to avoid or minimize a "suspension" of "operations" caused by destruction or corruption of "electronic data", or any loss or damage to "electronic data", except as provided under the Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations.

### 5. Additional Coverages

#### a. Civil Authority

In this Additional Coverage - Civil Authority, the described premises are premises to which this Coverage Form applies, as shown in the Declarations.

When a Covered Cause of Loss causes damage to property other than property at the described premises, we will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you sustain and necessary Extra Expense caused by action of civil authority that prohibits access to the described premises, provided that both of the following apply:

1. Access to the area immediately surrounding the damaged property is prohibited by civil authority as a result of the damage, and the described premises are within that area but are not more than one mile from the damaged property; and

2. The action of civil authority is taken in response to dangerous physical conditions resulting from the damage or continuation of the Covered Cause of Loss that caused the damage, or the action is taken to enable a civil authority to have unimpeded access to the damaged property.

Civil Authority Coverage for Business Income will begin immediately following the time of the first action of civil authority that prohibits access to the described premises; however, if a waiting period is shown in the Declarations, then after such period.

Civil Authority coverage for Extra Expense will begin immediately after the time of the first action of civil authority that prohibits access to the described premises and will end:

1. Four consecutive weeks after the date of that action; or

2. When your Civil Authority Coverage for Business Income ends, whichever is later.

#### b. Alterations And New Buildings

We will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you sustain and necessary Extra Expense you incur, subject to A.1. and 2. above, due to direct physical loss or damage at the described premises caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss to:

1. New buildings or structures, whether complete or under construction;

2. Alterations or additions to existing buildings or structures; and

3. Machinery, equipment, supplies or building materials located on or within 1,000 feet of the described premises and:

   - Used in the construction, alterations or additions; or
   - Incidental to the occupancy of new buildings.

If such direct physical loss or damage delays the start of "operations", the "period of restoration" for Business Income Coverage will begin on the date "operations" would have begun if the direct physical loss or damage had not occurred.

#### c. Extended Business Income

If the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" produces a Business Income loss payable under this policy, we will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you incur during the period that:

1. Begins on the date property (except "finished stock") is actually repaired, rebuilt or replaced and "operations" are resumed; and

2. Ends on the earlier of:

   - The date you could restore your "operations", with reasonable speed, to the level which would generate the business income.

amount that would have existed if destroy any part of the system or no direct physical loss or damage disrupt its normal operation. However, there is no coverage for an interruption related to manipulation of a computer system (including "electronic data") by any employee, including a temporary or leased employee, or by an entity retained by you or for you to inspect, design, install, maintain, repair or replace that system.

### (3) The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations

For all loss sustained and expense incurred in any one policy year, regardless of the number of interruptions or the number of premises, locations or computer systems involved is **$10,000**, unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations, subject to the following:

- **(a)** If at the time of interruption, the computer system is equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, this entire amount is available.
- **(b)** If at the time of interruption, the computer system is not equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, payment will be limited to **$2,500** for that occurrence.

If loss payment relating to the first interruption does not exhaust this amount, then the balance is available for loss or expense sustained or incurred as a result of subsequent interruptions in that policy year. A balance remaining at the end of a policy year does not increase the amount of insurance in the next policy year. With respect to any interruption which begins in one policy year and continues or results in additional loss or expense in a subsequent policy year(s), all loss and expense is deemed to be sustained or incurred in the policy year in which the interruption began.

### (4) This Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations

Does not apply to loss sustained or expense incurred after the end of the "period of restoration", even if the amount of insurance stated in (3) above has not been exhausted.

## NEWLY ACQUIRED LOCATIONS

1. You may extend your Business Income and Extra Expense Coverages to apply to property at any location you acquire other than fairs or exhibitions, if the location you acquire is intended for:
   - Similar use as the location described in the Declarations; or
   - Use as a warehouse.
   
2. The most we will pay under this extension for the sum of Business Income loss and Extra Expense incurred, is **$100,000** at each location.

3. Insurance under this Extension for each newly acquired location will end when any of the following first occurs:
   - This policy expires;
   - 60 days expire after you acquire or begin to construct the property; or
   - You report values to us.

We will charge you additional premium for values reported from the date you acquire the property.

## B. LOSS CONDITIONS

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

### 1. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the amount of Net Income and operating expense or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the amount of Net Income and operating expense or amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

- Pay its chosen appraiser; and
- Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

### 2. Duties In The Event Of Loss

a. You must see that the following are done in the event of loss:

   1. Notify the police if a law may have been broken.
   2. Give us prompt notice of the direct physical loss or damage. Include a description of the property involved.
   3. As soon as possible, give us a description of how, when, and where the direct physical loss or damage occurred.
   4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for any subsequent loss or damage resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.
   5. As often as may be reasonably required, permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records. Also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection, testing and analysis, and permit us to make copies from your books and records.
   6. Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss containing the information we request to investigate the claim. You must do this within 60 days after our request. We will supply you with the necessary forms.
   7. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.
   8. If you intend to continue your business, you must resume all or part of your "operations" as quickly as possible.

b. We may examine any insured under oath, while not in the presence of any other insured and at such times as may be reasonably required, about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim, including an insured's books and records. In the event of an examination, an insured's answers must be signed.

### 3. Loss Determination

a. The amount of Business Income loss will be determined based on:

   1. The Net Income of the business before the direct physical loss or damage occurred;
   2. The likely Net Income of the business if no physical loss or damage had occurred, but not including any Net Income that would likely have been earned as a result of an increase in the volume of business due to favorable business conditions caused by the impact of the

d. No insured will, except at that insured's own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume an obligation or incur any expense without our written consent.

### 4. Other Insurance

This insurance is primary. If any other insurance is also primary, then we will share with that other insurance by the method described below.

The words "we", "us" and "our" refer to the company providing this insurance. The word "insured" means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II – Who Is An Insured. Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Section V – Definitions.

## SECTION I – COVERAGES

### COVERAGE A – BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY

#### 1. Insuring Agreement

a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any "suit" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any "suit" seeking damages for "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any "occurrence" and settle any claim or "suit" that may result. But:

   1. The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in Section III – Limits Of Insurance; and

   2. Our right and duty to defend ends when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements under Coverages A or B or medical expenses under Coverage C.

   No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided for under Supplementary Payments – Coverages A and B.

b. This insurance applies to "bodily injury" and "property damage" only if:

   1. The "bodily injury" or "property damage" is caused by an "occurrence" that takes place in the "coverage territory";

   2. The "bodily injury" or "property damage" occurs during the policy period; and

   3. Prior to the policy period, no insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured and no "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim, knew that the "bodily injury" or "property damage" had occurred, in whole or in part. If such a listed insured or authorized "employee" knew, prior to the policy period, that the "bodily injury" or "property damage" occurred, then any continuation, change or resumption of such "bodily injury" or "property damage" during or after the policy period will be deemed to have been known prior to the policy period.

c. "Bodily injury" or "property damage" which occurs during the policy period and was not, prior to the policy period, known to have occurred by any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured or any "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim, includes any continuation, change or resumption of that "bodily injury" or "property damage" after the end of the policy period.

d. "Bodily injury" or "property damage" will be deemed to have been known to have occurred at the earliest time when any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured or any "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim:

   1. Reports all, or any part, of the "bodily injury" or "property damage" to us or any other insurer;

   2. Receives a written or verbal demand or claim for damages because of the "bodily injury" or "property damage"; or

b. If a claim is made or "suit" is brought against any insured, you must:

   1. Immediately record the specifics of the claim or "suit" and the date received; and
   2. Notify us as soon as practicable. You must see to it that we receive written notice of the claim or "suit" as soon as practicable.

c. You and any other involved insured must:

   2. Authorize us to obtain records and other information;
   3. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim or defense against the "suit"; and

d. No insured will, except at that insured's own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.

## 3. Legal Action Against Us

No person or organization has a right under this Coverage Part:

a. To join us as a party or otherwise bring us into a "suit" asking for damages from an insured; or  
b. To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of its terms have been fully complied with.

A person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed settlement or on a final judgment against an insured; but we will not be liable for damages that are not payable under the terms of this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the applicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability signed by us, the insured and the claimant or the claimant's legal representative.

## 4. Other Insurance

If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under Coverages A or B of this Coverage Part, our obligations are limited as follows:

### a. Primary Insurance

This insurance is primary except when Paragraph b. below applies. If this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in Paragraph c. below.

### b. Excess Insurance

1. This insurance is excess over:

   a. Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis:

      i. That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builder's Risk, Installation Risk or similar coverage for "your work";
      ii. That is Fire insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner;
      iii. That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for "property damage" to premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; or
      iv. If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use of aircraft, "autos" or watercraft to the extent not subject to Exclusion g. of Section I – Coverage A – Bodily Injury And Property Damage Liability.

   b. Any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations, or the products and completed operations, for which you have been added as an additional insured.

2. When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the insured against any "suit" if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that "suit". If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the insured's rights against all those other insurers.

3. When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of:

   a. The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance; and

### 8. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us

If the insured has rights to recover all or part of any payment we have made under this Coverage Part, those rights are transferred to us. The insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. At our request, the insured will bring "suit" or transfer those rights to us and help us enforce them.

### 9. When We Do Not Renew

If we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we will mail or deliver to the first Named Insured shown in the Declarations written notice of the nonrenewal not less than 30 days before the expiration date. If notice is mailed, proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice.

# COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY

**CG 00 33 12 07**  
**LIQUOR LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM**

Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, duties and what is and is not covered.

Throughout this policy the words "you" and "your" refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy. The words "we", "us", and "our" refer to the Company providing this insurance.

The word "insured" means any person or organization qualifying as such under **SECTION II - WHO IS AN INSURED**.

Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to **SECTION V - DEFINITIONS**.

## SECTION I - LIQUOR LIABILITY COVERAGE

### 1. Insuring Agreement

a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of "injury" to which this insurance applies if liability for such "injury" is imposed on the insured by reason of the selling, serving or furnishing of any alcoholic beverage. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any "suit" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any "suit" seeking damages for "injury" to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any "injury" and settle any claim or "suit" that may result. But:

   1. The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in **SECTION III - LIMITS OF INSURANCE**; and
   2. Our right and duty to defend ends when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements.

   No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided for under **SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS**.

b. This insurance applies to "injury" only if:

   1. The "injury" occurs during the policy period in the "coverage territory"; and
   2. Prior to the policy period, no insured listed under Paragraph 1. of **SECTION II - WHO IS AN INSURED** and no "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an injury or claim, knew that the "injury" had occurred, in whole or in part. If such a listed insured or authorized "employee" knew, prior to the policy period, that the "injury" occurred, then any continuation, change or resumption of such "injury" during or after the policy period will be deemed to have been known prior to the policy period.

c. "Injury" which occurs during the policy period and was not, prior to the policy period, known to have occurred by any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of **SECTION II - WHO IS AN INSURED** or any "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "injury" or claim, includes any continuation, change or resumption of that "injury" after the end of the policy period.

d. "Injury" will be deemed to have been known to have occurred at the earliest time when any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of **SECTION II - WHO IS AN INSURED** or any "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "injury" or claim:

   1. Reports all, or any part, of the "injury" to us or any other insurer;
   2. Receives a written or verbal demand or claim for damages because of the "injury"; or
   3. Becomes aware by any other means that "injury" has occurred or has begun to occur.

### 2. Exclusions

This insurance does not apply to:

a. **Expected Or Intended Injury**  
   "Injury" expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured. This exclusion does not apply to "bodily injury" resulting from the use of reasonable force to protect persons or property.

b. **Workers' Compensation And Similar Laws**  
   Any obligation of the insured under a workers' compensation, disability benefits or unemployment compensation law or any similar law.

This exclusion applies whether the insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity and to any obligation to share damages with or repay someone else who must pay damages because of the "injury".

### d. Liquor License Not In Effect

"Injury" arising out of any alcoholic beverage sold, served or furnished while any required license is not in effect.

### e. Your Product

"Injury" arising out of "your product". This exclusion does not apply to "injury" for which the insured or the insured's indemnitees may be held liable by reason of:

1. Causing or contributing to the intoxication of any person;
2. The furnishing of alcoholic beverages to a person under the legal drinking age or under the influence of alcohol; or
3. Any statute, ordinance or regulation relating to the sale, gift, distribution or use of alcoholic beverages.

### f. Other Insurance

Any "injury" with respect to which other insurance is afforded, or would be afforded but for the exhaustion of the limits of insurance.

### g. War

"Injury", however caused, arising, directly or indirectly, out of:

1. War, including undeclared or civil war;
2. Warlike action by a military force, including action in hindering or defending against an actual or expected attack, by any government, sovereign or other authority using military personnel or other agents; or
3. Insurrection, rebellion, revolution, usurped power, or action taken by governmental authority in hindering or defending against any of these.

2. The cost of bonds to release attachments, but only for bond amounts within the applicable limit of insurance. We do not have to furnish these bonds.

6. All interest on the full amount of any judgment that accrues after entry of the judgment and before we have paid, offered to pay, or deposited in court the part of the judgment that is within the applicable limit of insurance.
7. Expenses incurred by the insured for first aid administered to others at the time of an event to which this insurance applies.

In that case, the additional period will be deemed part of the last preceding period for purposes of determining the Limits of Insurance.

1. Authorize us to obtain records and other information in accordance with our rules and rates.
2. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim or defense against the "suit"; and
3. Assist us, upon our request, in the enforcement of any right against any person or organization which may be liable to the insured because of "injury" to which this insurance may also apply.
4. No insured will, except at that insured's own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.

## 3. Legal Action Against Us

No person or organization has a right under this Coverage Part:

- To join us as a party or otherwise bring us into a "suit" asking for damages from an insured; or
- To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of its terms have been fully complied with.

A person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed settlement or on a final judgment against an insured; but we will not be liable for damages that are not payable under the terms of this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the applicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability signed by us, the insured, and the claimant or the claimant's legal representative.

## 4. Other Insurance

If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under this Coverage Part, our obligations are limited as follows:

- **Primary Insurance**  
  This insurance is primary. Our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in b. below.

- **Method of Sharing**  
  If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach, each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first.  
  If any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.

## 5. Premium Audit

- We will compute all premiums for this Coverage Part in accordance with our rules and rates.
- Premium shown in this Coverage Part as advance premium is a deposit premium only. At the close of each audit period, we will compute the earned premium for that period and send notice to the first Named Insured. The due date for audit and retrospective premiums is the date shown as the due date on the bill. If the sum of the advance and audit premiums paid for the policy period is greater than the earned premium, we will return the excess to the first Named Insured.
- The first Named Insured must keep records of the information we need for premium computation, and send us copies at such times as we may request.

## 6. Representations

By accepting this policy, you agree:

- The statements in the Declarations are accurate and complete;
- Those statements are based upon representations you made to us; and
- We have issued this policy in reliance upon your representations.

## 7. Separation Of Insureds

Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part to the first Named Insured, this insurance applies:

- As if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured; and
- Separately to each insured against whom claim is made or "suit" is brought.

## 8. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us

If the insured has rights to recover all or part of any payment we have made under this Coverage Part, those rights are transferred to us. The insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. At our request, the insured will bring "suit" or transfer those rights to us and help us enforce them.

## 9. When We Do Not Renew

If we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we will mail or deliver to the first Named Insured shown in the Declarations written notice of the nonrenewal not less than 30 days before the expiration date. If notice is mailed, proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice.

## SECTION V - DEFINITIONS

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE COVERAGE

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was signed into law on November 26, 2002. The Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) defines an act of terrorism, to mean any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States to be:

1. **An act of terrorism;**
2. **A violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure;**
3. **To have resulted in damage within the United States or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission;** and
4. **To have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States government by coercion.**

Subject to the policy terms and conditions, this policy provides insurance coverage for acts of terrorism as defined in the Act.

Any coverage for certain commercial lines of property and casualty insurance provided by your policy for losses caused by certified acts of terrorism are partially paid by the federal government under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula, the government will reimburse us for 85% of such covered losses that exceed the statutory deductible paid by us. However, beginning January 1, 2016, the share will decrease 1% per calendar year until it equals 80%. 

You should also know that in the event aggregate insured losses exceed $100 billion during any year the Act is in effect, then the federal government and participating United States insurers that have met their insurer deductible shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of that amount of the loss that exceeds $100 billion. In the event that aggregate insured losses exceed $100 billion annually, no additional claims will be paid by the federal government or insurers. This formula is currently effective through December 31, 2020 unless extended.

The premium charge, if any, for this coverage is shown separately on the attached Declarations page. In the event of a certified act of terrorism, future policies also may include a government assessed terrorism loss risk-spreading premium in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

Please contact us if you would like to reject coverage for certified acts of terrorism.
