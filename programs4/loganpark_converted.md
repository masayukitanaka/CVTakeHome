## Note About Loss Control

Dear Valued Policyholder,

Slips, trips and falls are among the most frequent causes of loss. What might surprise you is that, many times, they result in claims and judgments in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which ultimately impact your insurance premium. In most instances, these claims can be lessened or prevented entirely simply by addressing the most common causes of such losses listed below.

### Most Common Causes

- Spills, wet or icy walking surfaces
- Uneven or worn floors/carpets/steps/sidewalks
- Inadequate or poorly maintained lighting
- Obstructed views
- Poor housekeeping - Excess clutter/trash in walkways or near open flames or hot surfaces

We encourage you to please take the time to periodically inspect your premises to see if any of these conditions exist and work to eliminate them where possible. Your efforts may save you money on future insurance premiums and, quite possibly, save your business.

Thank you for choosing and trusting us to help protect your business!

> “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”  
> —Benjamin Franklin

Thomas P. Nerney  
Chairman, President and CEO

## DISCLOSURE NOTICE OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE  
### RENEWALS

**Policy No.:** `NBP1555904G`

Dear Policyholder,

Terrorism Insurance Coverage is not included with this policy because you elected not to purchase this coverage on your expiring policy.

If you wish to purchase Terrorism Insurance Coverage on this policy, you must complete the attached form and return it to your local Retail Agent no later than **11/04/2024**.

Upon receipt of your completed form, we will endorse your policy to include Terrorism Insurance Coverage for the additional cost noted on the attached form.
```

# POLICYHOLDER DISCLOSURE NOTICE OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE

You are hereby notified that under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act ("the Act"), as amended, you have a right to purchase insurance coverage for losses arising out of acts of terrorism. As defined in Section 102 (1) of the Act: The term “act of terrorism” means any act or acts that are certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals, as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.

You should know that any coverage for losses caused by certified acts of terrorism is partially reimbursed by the United States under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula, the United States reimburses 80% of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance company providing the coverage. The premium charged for this coverage is provided below and does not include any charges for the portion of loss covered by the federal government under the Act. Coverage for "insured losses”, as defined in the Act, is subject to the coverage terms, conditions, amounts and limits in this policy applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism.

You should know that the Act, as amended, contains a $100 billion cap that limits U.S. Government reimbursement, as well as insurers' liability, for losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism when the amount of such losses in any one calendar year exceeds $100 billion. If the aggregate insured losses for all insurers exceed $100 billion in any one calendar year, your coverage may be reduced.

You should also know that, under federal law, you are not required to purchase coverage for losses caused by certified acts of terrorism.

## REJECTION OR SELECTION OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE

**Note:** In the states of California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, our terrorism exclusion makes an exception for fire losses resulting from an Act of Terrorism. In these states, if you decline to purchase Terrorism Coverage, you still have coverage for fire losses resulting from an Act of Terrorism.

Please “X” one of the boxes below and return this notice to the Company.

- [ ] I decline to purchase Terrorism Coverage. I understand that I will have no coverage for losses arising from acts of Terrorism.
- [ ] I elect to purchase coverage for certified acts of Terrorism for a premium of **$100**.
