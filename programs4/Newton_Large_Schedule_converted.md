# Automobile Composite Rating

In order to provide our insureds better service and administrative efficiency, Travelers Public Sector Services is pleased to provide the following process for handling mid-term automobile change requests. All requests will be managed in accordance with the Composite Rate Application outlined below. The insured should continue to submit all change requests to their agent for accurate record keeping and claims verification purposes. Particular attention should be paid to Item 5, which specifies the types of automobiles that will continue to require reporting to the Company.

## Composite Rate Application

1. If your policy includes the coverage for which a composite rate is designated in the table below then the premium for that coverage is composite rated. Automobile Liability is rated on a "per unit" basis and Automobile Physical Damage is rated on the basis of the original cost new of the autos. The composite rates reflect premium charges for any applicable miscellaneous auto coverages, with the exception of Garagekeepers Legal Liability.

2. The composite rates for Automobile Liability and Physical Damage are the rates applicable at the inception of the policy. Based on the information provided for this proposal and as of the date of this proposal, these rates are as follows:

   | LIABILITY | COMPREHENSIVE | COLLISION |
   |-----------|---------------|-----------|
   | Option 1  | $802          | 0.108     | 0.132     |

3. The premium charged at inception is the estimated annual premium based on the number of units and total original cost new for all covered autos on file with the company at inception. The insured is to submit a current schedule of owned automobiles as of the expiration of the policy and the total earned premium will be computed on the basis of the average net change in units and their corresponding original cost new for the policy term.

4. All autos added will carry the same Liability limits and Physical Damage deductibles issued at policy inception for autos of the same type.

5. Any new auto requiring valuation other than actual cash value must be reported within 30 days of acquisition. These autos will be added to the policy automobile schedule mid-term and a final premium will be determined at policy expiration.

# The Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002

The Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 as amended (“TRIA”) establishes a program under which the Federal Government may partially reimburse “Insured Losses” (as defined in TRIA) caused by “Acts Of Terrorism” (as defined in TRIA). “Act Of Terrorism” is defined in Section 102(1) of TRIA to mean any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury – in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States – to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.

The Federal Government’s share of compensation for such Insured Losses is 80% of the amount of such Insured Losses in excess of each Insurer’s “Insurer Deductible” (as defined in TRIA), subject to the “Program Trigger” (as defined in TRIA). In no event, however, will the Federal Government be required to pay any portion of the amount of such Insured Losses occurring in a calendar year that in the aggregate exceeds $100 billion, nor will any Insurer be required to pay any portion of such amount provided that such Insurer has met its Insurer Deductible. Therefore, if such Insured Losses occurring in a calendar year exceed $100 billion in the aggregate, the amount of any payments by the Federal Government and any coverage provided by this policy for losses caused by Acts Of Terrorism may be reduced.

For each coverage provided by this policy, other than Workers’ Compensation/Employers’ Liability, that applies to such Insured Losses, the charge for such Insured Losses that has been included for each such coverage is the percentage of the premium for such coverage indicated below, and does not include any charge for the portion of such Insured Losses covered by the Federal Government under TRIA.

For Workers' Compensation/Employers’ Liability coverage, the charge for such Insured Losses is an additional premium, which is reflected in the Workers’ Compensation/Employers’ Liability premium schedule, and does not include any charge for the portion of such Insured Losses covered by the Federal Government under TRIA.

# The Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002

The Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 as amended (“TRIA”) establishes a program under which the Federal Government may partially reimburse “Insured Losses” (as defined in TRIA) caused by “Acts Of Terrorism” (as defined in TRIA). “Act Of Terrorism” is defined in Section 102(1) of TRIA to mean any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury – in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States – to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.

The Federal Government’s share of compensation for such Insured Losses is 80% of the amount of such Insured Losses in excess of each Insurer’s “Insurer Deductible” (as defined in TRIA), subject to the “Program Trigger” (as defined in TRIA).

In no event, however, will the Federal Government be required to pay any portion of the amount of such Insured Losses occurring in a calendar year that in the aggregate exceeds $100 billion, nor will any Insurer be required to pay any portion of such amount provided that such Insurer has met its Insurer Deductible. Therefore, if such Insured Losses occurring in a calendar year exceed $100 billion in the aggregate, the amount of any payments by the Federal Government and any coverage provided by this policy for losses caused by Acts Of Terrorism may be reduced.

For any Workers Compensation and Employers Liability coverage provided by this policy, the charge for such Insured Losses is an additional premium, which is reflected in any Workers Compensation and Employers Liability premium schedule included in this proposal or, if this proposal does not include such premium schedule, is reflected in a Workers Compensation premium summary included with this proposal. **Note:** terrorism premium charges listed in any such premium schedule or summary are subject to change at any time based on state regulatory action.

For any coverage provided by this policy, other than any Workers Compensation and Employers Liability coverage, that applies to such Insured Losses, the charge for such Insured Losses is included in the premium for such coverage. The charge for such Insured Losses that has been included for any such coverage is the percentage of the premium for such coverage indicated below and does not include any charge for the portion of such Insured Losses covered by the Federal Government under TRIA. **Note:** terrorism premium charges shown below are subject to change at any time based on state regulatory action.

### The charge for such Insured Losses (for any coverage other than any Workers Compensation and Employers Liability coverage) is:

- **7%** of either your total Commercial Property Coverage Part or your total Deluxe Property Coverage Part premium, if applicable, if your primary location is in a Designated City (as listed below).
- **3%** of either your total Commercial Property Coverage Part or your total Deluxe Property Coverage Part premium, if applicable, if your primary location is not in a Designated City (as listed below).
- **4%** of your total Businessowners Coverage Part premium, if applicable, if your primary location is in a Designated City (as listed below).
- **2%** of your total Businessowners Coverage Part premium, if applicable, if your primary location is not in a Designated City (as listed below).
- **1%** of your total Commercial Inland Marine Coverage Part premium if applicable.
- **1%** of your total Boiler and Machinery or Equipment Breakdown Coverage Part if applicable.
- **1%** of your total premium for any Commercial Liability Coverage included in this policy that is subject to the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 as amended.
- **1%** of your total premium for any Commercial Ocean Marine Coverage Part premium if applicable.
