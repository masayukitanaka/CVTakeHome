## AUTO-OWNERS INSURANCE COMPANY

### NOTICE CONCERNING POLICYHOLDER RIGHTS IN AN INSOLVENCY UNDER THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION LAW

The financial strength of your insurer is one of the most important things for you to consider when determining from whom to purchase a property or liability insurance policy. It is your best assurance that you will receive the protection for which you purchased the policy. If your insurer becomes insolvent, you may have protection from the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association as described below but to the extent that your policy is not protected by the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association or if it exceeds the guaranty association's limits, you will only have the assets, if any, of the insolvent insurer to satisfy your claim.

Residents of Minnesota who purchase property and casualty or liability insurance from insurance companies licensed to do business in Minnesota are protected, **SUBJECT TO LIMITS AND EXCLUSIONS**, in the event the insurer becomes insolvent. This protection is provided by the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association.

**Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association**  
7600 Parklawn Avenue  
Edina, Minnesota 55435-5137  
(952) 831-1908  

The maximum amount that the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association will pay in regard to a claim under all policies issued by the same insurer is limited to $300,000. This limit does not apply to workers' compensation insurance. Protection by the guaranty association is subject to other substantial limitations and exclusions. If your claim exceeds the guaranty association's limits, you may still recover a part or all of that amount from the proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvent insurer, if any exist. Funds to pay claims may not be immediately available. The guaranty association assesses insurers licensed to sell property and casualty or liability insurance in Minnesota after the insolvency occurs. Claims are paid from the assessment.

**THE PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR USING CARE IN SELECTING INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE WELL MANAGED AND FINANCIALLY STABLE. IN SELECTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY OR POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON PROTECTION BY THE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION.**

**THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED BY MINNESOTA STATE LAW TO ADVISE POLICYHOLDERS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES OF THEIR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT THEIR INSURANCE CARRIER BECOMES INSOLVENT. THIS NOTICE IN NO WAY IMPLIES THAT THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. ALL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THIS NOTICE.**

# NOTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE CHANGES IN COVERAGE FOR TERRORISM

Dear Policyholder:

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) will expire on December 31, 2027 unless the Federal government extends the Act. What this means to you is the following:

1. Subject to policy terms and conditions, the enclosed policy will provide insurance coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined in the Act only until December 31, 2027.

2. A conditional endorsement entitled, **Conditional Exclusion Of Terrorism Involving Nuclear, Biological Or Chemical Terrorism (Relating To Disposition Of Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act)** is enclosed. This conditional endorsement will only apply if the Act is not extended or if the Act is revised to increase statutory deductibles, decrease the federal government's share in potential losses above the statutory deductibles, change the levels, terms or conditions of coverage and we are no longer required to make terrorism coverage available and elect not to do so. It will not apply if the Act is simply extended.

3. The conditional endorsement will provide coverage for an incident of terrorism pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy only if the incident does not involve nuclear, biological or chemical material.

4. A premium charge for the conditional endorsement will be applied effective January 1, 2028. The premium will be prorated for the remainder of the policy term and is one-half of the current premium charge appearing in the Declarations for **TERRORISM - CERTIFIED ACTS**. However, it will only be made if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) is not extended. Revised Declarations will be mailed to you after January 1, 2028.

5. If the Act is extended without any revision, the enclosed policy will continue to provide coverage for certified acts of terrorism. The conditional endorsement will not be activated and the changes in coverage or premium referenced above will not apply.

6. If the Act is extended with revisions or is replaced, and we are required or elect to continue to offer coverage for certified acts of terrorism, we may amend this policy in accordance with the provisions of the revised Act or its replacement.

This notice is for informational purposes only.

If you have any questions concerning your policy or this notice, please contact your Auto-Owners agency.

# Policy Details

**Agency Code:** `06-0883-00`  
**Policy Number:** `224706-08546030`

In the endorsement, if no applicable Deductible is shown in the Schedule for a coverage, the policy Deductible shown in the Declarations will apply to such coverage unless otherwise stated.

In any one occurrence of loss or damage (hereinafter referred to as loss), the Deductible will apply as follows:

1. **Multiple Deductibles** may apply to a loss. However, if multiple types of Covered Property are involved in a loss and different Deductibles are shown in the Schedule for the different types of Covered Property, only the largest applicable Deductible for each coverage will apply.

   When a Deductible in the Schedule applies to a Business Income or Extra Expense loss, such Deductible applies in place of any waiting period set forth in the BUSINESS INCOME form attached to this policy.

2. If the adjusted amount of loss is less than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for that loss. If the adjusted amount of loss exceeds the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deductible from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

3. The Schedule may indicate Direct Coverages Deductibles and Indirect Coverages Deductibles. Unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule, Indirect Coverages Deductibles apply to Business Income loss and Extra Expense loss and Direct Coverages Deductibles apply to all other loss.

4. When a **Dollar Deductible** is shown in the Schedule, we will subtract the Deductible amount from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

5. When a **Time Deductible** is shown in the Schedule, we will not pay for loss that occurs during the specified time period immediately following the "Equipment Breakdown" occurrence. If the Time Deductible is expressed as a number of days, each day means twenty-four consecutive hours.

6. When a **Multiple of ADV Deductible** is shown in the Schedule, the amount of the Deductible will be calculated as follows:

   a. Take the amount of Business Income that you would have earned during the "period of restoration" had no "Equipment Breakdown" loss occurred (Business Income and "period of restoration" have the meanings set forth in the BUSINESS INCOME form attached to this policy). The Business Income will include the entire location regardless of the loss affecting the entire location or part of the location. If two or more locations are affected in the "Equipment Breakdown" loss, the Business Income will be the combined amount of all affected locations.

   b. Take the result in paragraph 6.a. and divide it by the number of days your business would have been operating during the "period of restoration" had no "Equipment Breakdown" occurred. This result is the Average Daily Value.

   c. The Average Daily Value calculated in paragraph 6.b. multiplied by the number shown in the Schedule is the amount of the Multiple of ADV Deductible. We will subtract this amount from the amount of loss we would otherwise pay and will pay the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.

### Additional Conditions

**F. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS** is amended. The following Conditions are added for purposes of this endorsement only:

1. **Suspension**

Agency Code `06-0883-00`  
Policy Number `224706-08546030`

The debris removal expense is less than 25% of the sum of the loss payable plus the deductible. The sum of the loss payable and the debris removal expense ($49,500 + $10,000 = $59,500) is less than the Limit of Insurance. Therefore, the full amount of debris removal expense is payable in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (3).

### EXAMPLE #1

| Description                  | Amount     |
|------------------------------|------------|
| Limit of Insurance           | $90,000    |
| Amount of Deductible         | $500       |
| Amount of Loss               | $50,000    |
| Amount of Loss Payable       | $49,500    |
| Debris Removal Expense       | $10,000    |
| Debris Removal Expense Payable | $10,000  |

($10,000 is 20% of $50,000.)

### EXAMPLE #2

| Description                  | Amount     |
|------------------------------|------------|
| Limit of Insurance           | $90,000    |
| Amount of Deductible         | $500       |
| Amount of Loss               | $80,000    |
| Amount of Loss Payable       | $79,500    |
| Debris Removal Expense       | $30,000    |
| Debris Removal Expense Payable |          |
| Basic Amount                 | $10,500    |
| Additional Amount            | $10,000    |

The basic amount payable for debris removal expense under the terms of Paragraph (3) is calculated as follows: $80,000 ($79,500 + $500) x .25 = $20,000; capped at $10,500. The cap applies because the sum of the loss payable ($79,500) and the basic amount payable for debris removal expense ($10,500) cannot exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000).

The additional amount payable for debris removal expense is provided in accordance with the terms of Paragraph (4), because the debris removal expense ($30,000) exceeds 25% of the loss payable plus the deductible ($30,000 is 37.5% of $80,000), and because the sum of the loss payable and debris removal expense ($79,500 + $30,000 = $109,500) would exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000). The additional amount of covered debris removal expense is $10,000, the maximum payable under Paragraph (4). Thus, the total payable for debris removal expense in this example is $20,500; $9,500 of the debris removal expense is not covered.

### Preservation Of Property

If it is necessary to move Covered Property from the described premises to preserve it from loss or damage by a Covered Cause of Loss, we will pay for any direct physical loss or damage to that property:

1. While it is being moved or while temporarily stored at another location; and
2. Only if the loss or damage occurs within 45 days, unless a higher number of days are shown in the Declarations, after the property is first moved.

## Examples

In the following examples, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance. The following examples assume there is no Coinsurance penalty.

### Example #1

- **Deductible:** $250
- **Limit of Insurance - Building #1:** $60,000
- **Limit of Insurance - Building #2:** $80,000
- **Loss to Building #1:** $60,100
- **Loss to Building #2:** $90,000

The amount of loss to Building #1 ($60,100) is less than the sum ($60,250) of the Limit of Insurance applicable to Building #1 plus the Deductible.

The Deductible will be subtracted from the amount of loss in calculating the loss payable for Building #1:

```
$60,100
- 250

## E. Loss Conditions

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

### 1. Abandonment

There can be no abandonment of any property to us.

### 2. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

- a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
- b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

a. You must see that the following are done in the event of loss or damage to Covered Property:

1. Notify the police if a law may have been broken.

3. As soon as possible, give us a description of how, when and where the loss or damage occurred.
4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for any subsequent loss or damage resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.
5. At our request, give us complete inventories of the damaged and undamaged property. Include quantities, costs, values and amount of loss claimed.
6. As often as may be reasonably required, permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records. Also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection, testing and analysis, and permit us to make copies from your books and records.
7. Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss containing the information we request to investigate the claim. You must do this within 60 days after our request. We will supply you with the necessary forms.
8. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.

b. We may examine any insured under oath, while not in the presence of any other insured and at such times as may be reasonably required, about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim, including an insured's books and records. In the event of an examination, an insured's answers must be signed.

### 4. Loss Payment

a. In the event of loss or damage covered by this Coverage Form, at our option, we will either:

# Insurance Policy Details

**Agency Code:** `06-0883-00`  
**Policy Number:** `224706-08546030`

## Loss Payment Conditions

1. **Repair, Rebuild, or Replace**

   - We will determine the value of lost or damaged property, or the cost of its repair or replacement, in accordance with the applicable terms of the Valuation Condition in this Coverage Form or any applicable provision which amends or supersedes the Valuation Condition.
   - The cost to repair, rebuild, or replace does not include the increased cost attributable to enforcement of any ordinance or law regulating the construction, use, or repair of any property.
   - We will give notice of our intentions within 30 days after we receive the sworn proof of loss.
   - We will not pay you more than your financial interest in the Covered Property.
   - We may adjust losses with the owners of lost or damaged property if other than you. If we pay the owners, such payments will satisfy your claims against us for the owners’ property. We will not pay the owners more than their financial interest in the Covered Property.
   - We may elect to defend you against suits arising from claims of owners of property. We will do this at our expense.
   - We will pay for covered loss or damage within 30 days after we receive the sworn proof of loss, if you have complied with all of the terms of this Coverage Part and:
     1. We have reached agreement with you on the amount of loss; or
     2. An appraisal award has been made.
   - A party wall is a wall that separates and is common to adjoining buildings that are owned by different parties. In settling covered losses involving a party wall, we will pay a proportion of the loss to the party wall based on your interest in the wall in proportion to the interest of the owner of the adjoining building. However, if you elect to repair or replace your building and the owner of the adjoining building elects not to repair or replace that building, we will pay you the full value of the loss to the party wall, subject to all applicable policy provisions including Limits of Insurance, the Valuation and Coinsurance Conditions, and all other provisions of this Loss Payment Condition. Our payment under the provisions of this paragraph does not alter any right of subrogation we may have against any entity, including the owner or insurer of the adjoining building, and does not alter the terms of the Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us Condition in this policy.

2. **Recovered Property**

   - If either you or we recover any property after loss settlement, that party must give the other prompt notice.
   - If you recover the property, at your option, you may retain the property. You must then return to us the amount we paid to you for the property less any expenses to repair the Covered Property and expenses incurred to recover the property. You may give us the recovered property in which case we will pay recovery expenses, subject to the Limit of Insurance.
   - If we recover the property, at your option, we may return the property to you. We will pay any recovery expenses, subject to the Limit of Insurance. We will also pay any expenses to repair the Covered Property, subject to the Limit of Insurance. However, before we return the Covered Property or pay for the repair of the Covered Property, you must first return to us the amount we paid to you for the property.

3. **Vacancy**

   - **Description Of Terms**
     1. As used in this Vacancy Condition, the term building and the term vacant have the meanings set forth in (1)(a) and (1)(b) below:
        - When this policy is issued to a tenant, and with respect to that tenant's interest in Covered Property, building means the unit or suite rented or leased to the tenant. Such building is vacant when it does not contain enough business personal property to conduct customary operations.
        - When this policy is issued to the owner or general lessee of a building, building means the entire building. Such building is vacant unless at least 31% of its total square footage is:
          1. Rented to a lessee or sub-lessee and used by the lessee or sub-lessee to conduct its customary operations; and/or
          2. Used by the building owner to conduct customary operations.

# Insurance Policy Details

**Agency Code:** `06-0883-00`  
**Policy Number:** `224706-08546030`

## Vacancy Provisions

1. **Buildings under construction or renovation** are not considered vacant.

2. **Vacancy Provisions:**

   If the building where loss or damage occurs has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days before that loss or damage occurs:

   - **We will not pay for any loss or damage caused by any of the following even if they are Covered Causes of Loss:**
     - Vandalism;
     - Sprinkler leakage, unless you have protected the system against freezing;
     - Building glass breakage;
     - Water damage;
     - Theft; or
     - Attempted theft.

   - **With respect to Covered Causes of Loss other than those listed above, we will reduce the amount we would otherwise pay for the loss or damage by 15%.**

## Valuation

We will determine the value of Covered Property in the event of loss or damage as follows:

- **At actual cash value** as of the time of loss or damage, except as provided in b., c., d., and e. below.

- **If the Limit of Insurance for Building satisfies the Additional Condition, Coinsurance, and the cost to repair or replace the damaged building property is $2,500 or less, we will pay the cost of building repairs or replacement.**

  - The cost of building repairs or replacement does not include the increased cost attributable to enforcement of any ordinance or law regulating the construction, use, or repair of any property.

  - However, the following property will be valued at the actual cash value even when attached to the building:
    1. Awnings or floor coverings;
    2. Appliances for refrigerating, ventilating, cooking, dishwashing, or laundering; or
    3. Outdoor equipment or furniture.

- **Tenants' Improvements and Betterments:**
  1. Actual cash value of the lost or damaged property if you make repairs promptly.
  2. A proportion of your original cost if you do not make repairs promptly. We will determine the proportionate value as follows:
     - Multiply the original cost by the number of days from the loss or damage to the expiration of the lease; and
     - Divide the amount determined above by the number of days from the installation of improvements to the expiration of the lease.
     - If your lease contains a renewal option, the expiration of the renewal option period will replace the expiration of the lease in the procedure.
  3. Nothing if others pay for repairs or replacement.

## Additional Conditions

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

### Coinsurance

If a Coinsurance percentage is shown in the Declarations, the following condition applies:

- We will not pay the full amount of any loss if the value of Covered Property at the time of loss times the Coinsurance percentage shown for it in the Declarations is greater than the Limit of Insurance for the property.

- Instead, we will determine the most we will pay using the following steps:
  1. Multiply the value of Covered Property at the time of loss by the Coinsurance percentage;
  2. Divide the Limit of Insurance of the property by the figure determined in Step (1);
  3. Multiply the total amount of loss, before the application of any deductible, by the figure determined in Step (2); and
  4. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in Step (3).

- We will pay the amount determined in Step (4) or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less. For the remainder, you will either have to rely on other insurance or absorb the loss yourself.

# Insurance Policy Details

**Agency Code:** `06-0883-00`  
**Policy Number:** `224706-08546030`

In the following examples, the figures used are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect your actual insurance.

- **Building at Location #2:** $30,000
- **Personal Property at Location #2:** $20,000
- **Total:** $50,000

## Example #1 (Underinsurance)

**Step (1):**  
$250,000 x 90% = $225,000  
(the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Co-insurance requirements and to avoid the penalty shown below)

- **When:**
  - The value of the property is: $250,000
  - The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 80%
  - The Limit of Insurance for it is: $100,000
  - The Deductible is: $250
  - The amount of loss is: $40,000

**Step (2):**  
$180,000 ÷ $225,000 = .80

**Step (3):**  
$50,000 x .80 = $40,000

**Step (4):**  
$40,000 - $1,000 = $39,000

- **Step (1):**  
  $250,000 x 80% = $200,000  
  (the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Co-insurance requirements)

**Step (2):**  
$100,000 ÷ $200,000 = .50

**Step (3):**  
$40,000 x .50 = $20,000

**Step (4):**  
$20,000 - $250 = $19,750

We will pay no more than $19,750. The remaining $20,250 is not covered.

## Example #2 (Adequate Insurance)

- **When:**
  - The value of the property is: $250,000
  - The Coinsurance percentage for it is: 80%
  - The Limit of Insurance for it is: $200,000
  - The Deductible is: $250
  - The amount of loss is: $40,000

The minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($250,000 x 80%). Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this example is adequate and no penalty applies. We will pay no more than $39,750 ($40,000 amount of loss minus the deductible of $250).

- **b.** If one Limit of Insurance applies to two or more separate items, this condition will apply to the total of all property to which the limit applies.

## Example #3

- **When:**
  - The value of the property is:
    - Building at Location #1: $75,000
    - Building at Location #2: $100,000
    - Personal Property at Location #2: $75,000
    - **Total:** $250,000

- **The Coinsurance percentage for it is:** 90%
- **The Limit of Insurance for Buildings and Personal Property at Locations #1 and #2 is:** $180,000
- **The Deductible is:** $1,000
- **The amount of loss is:**

## Mortgageholders

1. **Mortgageholders**
   - **a.** The term mortgageholder includes trustee.
   - **b.** We will pay for covered loss of or damage to buildings or structures to each mortgageholder shown in the Declarations in their order of precedence, as interests may appear.
   - **c.** The mortgageholder has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgageholder has started foreclosure or similar action on the building or structure.
   - **d.** If we deny your claim because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part, the mortgageholder will still have the right to receive loss payment if the mortgageholder:
     1. Pays any premium due under this Coverage Part at our request if you have failed to do so;
     2. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so; and
     3. Has notified us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk known to the mortgageholder.
   - All of the terms of this Coverage Part will then apply directly to the mortgageholder.
   - **e.** If we pay the mortgageholder for any loss or damage and deny payment to you because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this Coverage Part:
     1. The mortgageholder's rights under the mortgage will be transferred to us to the extent of the amount we pay; and
     2. The mortgageholder's right to recover the full amount of the mortgageholder's claim will not be impaired.
     - At our option, we may pay to the mortgageholder the whole principal on the mortgage.

## Business Income Coverage

### Extended Business Income

1. **Business Income Other Than "Rental Value"**

   If the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" produces a Business Income loss payable under this policy, we will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you incur during the period that:

   - **Begins** on the date property (except "finished stock") is actually repaired, rebuilt or replaced and "operations" are resumed; and
   - **Ends** on the earlier of:
     1. The date you could restore your "operations", with reasonable speed, to the level which would generate the business income amount that would have existed if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred; or
     2. 30 consecutive days after the date determined in (1)(a) above.

   However, Extended Business Income does not apply to loss of Business Income incurred as a result of unfavorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss in the area where the described premises are located.

   Loss of Business Income must be caused by direct physical loss or damage at the described premises caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.

2. **"Rental Value"**

   If the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" produces a "Rental Value" loss payable under this policy, we will pay for the actual loss of "Rental Value" you incur during the period that:

   - **Begins** on the date property is actually repaired, rebuilt or replaced and tenantability is restored; and
   - **Ends** on the earlier of:
     1. The date you could restore tenant occupancy, with reasonable speed, to the level which would generate the "Rental Value" that would have existed if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred; or
     2. 30 consecutive days after the date determined in (2)(a) above.

   However, Extended Business Income does not apply to loss of "Rental Value" incurred as a result of unfavorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss in the area where the described premises are located.

   Loss of "Rental Value" must be caused by direct physical loss or damage at the described premises caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.

**Agency Code:** `06-0883-00`  
**Policy Number:** `224706-08546030`

## Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations

1. **Coverage Details:**
   - Introduced into or enacted on a computer system (including "electronic data") or a network to which it is connected, designed to damage or destroy any part of the system or disrupt its normal operation. However, there is no coverage for an interruption related to manipulation of a computer system (including "electronic data") by any employee, including a temporary or leased employee, or by an entity retained by you or for you to inspect, design, install, maintain, repair or replace that system.

2. **Coverage Limit:**
   - The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations for all loss sustained and expense incurred in any one policy year, regardless of the number of interruptions or the number of premises, locations, or computer systems involved is $10,000, unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations, subject to the following:
     - (a) If at the time of interruption, the computer system is equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, this entire amount is available.
     - (b) If at the time of interruption, the computer system is not equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, payment will be limited to $2,500 for that occurrence.

3. **Policy Year Considerations:**
   - If loss payment relating to the first interruption does not exhaust this amount, then the balance is available for loss or expense sustained or incurred as a result of subsequent interruptions in that policy year. A balance remaining at the end of a policy year does not increase the amount of insurance in the next policy year. With respect to any interruption which begins in one policy year and continues or results in additional loss or expense in a subsequent policy year(s), all loss and expense is deemed to be sustained or incurred in the policy year in which the interruption began.

4. **Exclusions:**
   - This Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations does not apply to loss sustained or expense incurred after the end of the "period of restoration", even if the amount of insurance stated in (3) above has not been exhausted.

Coverages and are separate from the Limit(s) of Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if Insurance shown in the Declarations for any other coverage:

- **Interruption Of Computer Operations Additional Coverage**
- **Newly Acquired Locations Coverage Extension**

## C. Loss Conditions

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

### 1. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the amount of Net Income and operating expense or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser.

The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the amount of Net Income and operating expense or amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding.

Each party will:

- a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
- b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

### 2. Duties In The Event Of Loss

a. You must see that the following are done in the event of loss:

   1. Notify the police if a law may have been broken.
   2. Give us prompt notice of the direct physical loss or damage. Include a description of the property involved.
   3. As soon as possible, give us a description of how, when, and where the direct physical loss or damage occurred.
   4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for any subsequent loss or damage resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.
   5. As often as may be reasonably required, permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records. Also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection, testing and analysis, and permit us to make copies from your books and records.
   6. Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss containing the information we request to investigate the claim. You must do this within 60 days after our request. We will supply you with the necessary forms.
   7. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.
   8. If you intend to continue your business, you must resume all or part of your "operations" as quickly as possible.

b. We may examine any insured under oath, while not in the presence of any other insured and at such times as may be reasonably required, about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim, including an insured's books and records. In the event of an examination, an insured's answers must be signed.

### 3. Loss Determination

a. The amount of Business Income loss will be determined based on:

   1. The Net Income of the business before the direct physical loss or damage occurred;
   2. The likely Net Income of the business if no physical loss or damage had occurred, but not including any Net Income that would likely have been earned as a result of an increase in the volume of business due to favorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss on customers or on other businesses;
   3. The operating expenses, including payroll expenses, necessary to resume "operations" with the same quality of service that existed just before the direct physical loss or damage.

b. The amount of Extra Expense will be determined based on:

1. All expenses that exceed the normal operating expenses that would have been incurred by "operations" during the "period of restoration" if no direct physical loss or damage had occurred. We will deduct from the total of such expenses:

   - (b) Any Extra Expense that is paid for by other insurance, except for insurance that is written subject to the same plan, terms, conditions and provisions as this insurance; and

# Insurance Policy Details

**Agency Code:** `06-0883-00`  
**Policy Number:** `224706-08546030`

## Cost Considerations

1. **Cost of raw stock and factory supplies consumed** (including transportation charges)
2. **Cost of merchandise sold** (including transportation charges)
3. **Cost of other supplies consumed** (including transportation charges)
4. **Cost of services purchased from outsiders** (not employees) to resell, that do not continue under contract
5. **Power, heat and refrigeration expenses** that do not continue under contract (if `Form CP 15 11` is attached)
6. **All ordinary payroll expenses** or the amount of payroll expense excluded (if `Form CP 15 10` is attached)
7. **Special deductions for mining properties** (royalties unless specifically included in coverage; actual depletion commonly known as unit or cost depletion - not percentage depletion; welfare and retirement fund charges based on tonnage; hired trucks)

Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this example is adequate and no penalty applies. We will pay no more than $80,000 (amount of loss).

This condition does not apply to Extra Expense Coverage.

## E. Optional Coverages

If shown as applicable in the Declarations, the following Optional Coverages apply separately to each item.

### 1. Maximum Period Of Indemnity

a. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to this Coverage Form at the described premises to which this Optional Coverage applies.  
b. The most we will pay for the total of Business Income loss and Extra Expense is the lesser of:

   1. The amount of loss sustained and expenses incurred during the 120 days immediately following the beginning of the "period of restoration"; or
   2. The Limit of Insurance shown in the Declarations.

### 2. Monthly Limit Of Indemnity

a. The Additional Condition, Coinsurance, does not apply to this Coverage Form at the described premises to which this Optional Coverage applies.  
b. The most we will pay for loss of Business Income in each period of 30 consecutive days after the beginning of the "period of restoration" is:

   1. The Limit of Insurance, multiplied by
   2. The fraction shown in the Declarations for this Optional Coverage.

## Example #1 (Underinsurance)

- **When:** The Net Income and operating expenses for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy at the described premises would have been: $400,000  
- **The Coinsurance percentage is:** 50%  
- **The Limit of Insurance is:** $150,000  
- **The amount of loss is:** $80,000  

**Steps:**

1. $400,000 x 50% = $200,000 (the minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirements)
2. $150,000 ÷ $200,000 = 0.75
3. $80,000 x 0.75 = $60,000

We will pay no more than $60,000. The remaining $20,000 is not covered.

## Example #2 (Adequate Insurance)

- **When:** The Net Income and operating expenses for the 12 months following the inception, or last previous anniversary date, of this policy at the described premises would have been: $400,000  
- **The Coinsurance percentage is:** 50%  
- **The Limit of Insurance is:** $200,000  
- **The amount of loss is:** $80,000  

The minimum amount of insurance to meet your Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($400,000 x 50%).

### Example

- **When:** The Limit of Insurance is: $120,000  
- **The fraction shown in the Declarations for this Optional Coverage is:** 1/4  
- **The most we will pay for loss in each period of 30 consecutive days is:** $30,000 ($120,000 x 1/4 = $30,000)

If, in this example, the actual amount of loss is:

- **Days 1-30:** $40,000  
- **Days 31-60:** $20,000  
- **Days 61-90:** $30,000  
- **Total:** $90,000

bending, leaning, settling, shrinkage or expansion.

1. The coverage described in E.2. and E.6. only applies when the "fungi", wet rot or dry rot is the result of a "specified cause of loss" other than fire or lightning that occurs during the policy term and only if all reasonable means were used to save and preserve the property from further damage at the time of and after that occurrence.

2. We will pay for loss or damage by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot. As used in this Limited Coverage, the term loss or damage means:

If a particular occurrence results in loss or damage by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot, and other loss or damage, we will not pay more, for the total of all loss or damage, than the applicable Limit of Insurance on the affected Covered Property.

If there is covered loss or damage to Covered Property, not caused by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot, loss payment will not be limited by the terms of this Limited Coverage, except to the extent that "fungi", wet rot or dry rot causes an increase in the loss.

   a. If the loss which resulted in "fungi", wet rot or dry rot does not in itself necessitate a "suspension" of "operations", but such "suspension" is necessary due to loss or damage to property caused by "fungi", wet rot or dry rot, then our payment under Business Income and/or Extra Expense is limited to the amount of loss and/or expense sustained in a period of not more than 45 days. The days need not be consecutive.

   b.

# BUSINESS INCOME (AND EXTRA EXPENSE)  
## ACTUAL LOSS SUSTAINED COVERAGE FORM

Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, duties and what is and is not covered.

Throughout this policy the words "you" and "your" refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations. The words "we", "us" and "our" refer to the Company providing this insurance.

Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Section C., DEFINITIONS.

The descriptions in the headings of this Coverage Form and all applicable endorsements are solely for convenience and form no part of the terms and conditions of coverage.

### A. COVERAGE

#### 1. Business Income

a. Business Income means the:

   1. **Net Income** (Net Profit or Loss before income taxes) that would have been earned or incurred; and
   2. Continuing normal operating expenses incurred, including payroll.

   For manufacturing risks, Net Income includes the net sales value of production.

b. We will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you sustain due to the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" during the "period of restoration". The "suspension" must be caused by direct physical loss of or damage to property at premises which are described in the Declarations and for which ACTUAL LOSS SUSTAINED is shown in the Declarations. The loss or damage must be caused by or result from a Covered Cause of Loss. With respect to loss of or damage to personal property in the open or personal property in a vehicle, the described premises include the area within 1,000 feet of the site at which the described premises are located.

   With respect to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph, if you occupy only part of the site at which the described premises are located, your premises means:

   1. The portion of the building which you rent, lease or occupy; and
   2. Any area within the building or on the site at which the described premises are located, if that area services, or is used to gain access to, the described premises.

c. We will only pay for loss of Business Income that you sustain during the "period of restoration" and that occurs within the number of months shown in the Declarations after the date of direct physical loss or damage.

#### 2. Extra Expense

a. Extra Expense Coverage is provided at the premises described in the Declarations only if the Declarations show that Business Income Coverage applies at that premises.

b. Extra Expense means necessary expenses you incur during the "period of restoration" that you would not have incurred if there had been no direct physical loss or damage to property caused by or resulting from a Covered Cause of Loss.

   We will pay Extra Expense (other than the expense to repair or replace property) to:

   1. Avoid or minimize the "suspension" of business and to continue operations at the described premises or at replacement premises or temporary locations, including relocation expenses and costs to equip and operate the replacement location or temporary location.
   2. Minimize the "suspension" of business if you cannot continue "operations".

   We will also pay Extra Expense to repair or replace property, but only to the extent it reduces the amount of loss that otherwise would have been payable under this Coverage Form.

   We will only pay for Extra Expense that occurs within the number of months shown in the Declarations after the date of direct physical loss or damage.

## 5. Additional Coverages

### a. Civil Authority

In this Additional Coverage - Civil Authority, the described premises are premises to which this Coverage Form applies, as shown in the Declarations.

- When a Covered Cause of Loss causes damage to property other than property at the described premises, we will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you sustain and necessary Extra Expense caused by action of civil authority that prohibits access to the described premises, provided that both of the following apply:
  1. Access to the area immediately surrounding the damaged property is prohibited by civil authority as a result of the damage, and the described premises are within that area but are not more than one mile from the damaged property; and
  2. The action of civil authority is taken in response to dangerous physical conditions resulting from the damage or continuation of the Covered Cause of Loss that caused the damage, or the action is taken to enable a civil authority to have unimpeded access to the damaged property.

Civil Authority Coverage for Business Income will begin immediately following the time of the first action of civil authority that prohibits access to the described premises; however, if a waiting period is shown in the Declarations, then after such period.

### c. Extended Business Income

If the necessary "suspension" of your "operations" produces a Business Income loss payable under this policy, we will pay for the actual loss of Business Income you incur during the period that:

1. Begins on the date property (except "finished stock") is actually repaired, rebuilt or replaced and "operations" are resumed; and
2. Ends on the earlier of:

**Policy Number:** `224706-08546030`

## Business Income Coverage

- **Extended Business Income** does not apply to loss of Business Income incurred as a result of unfavorable business conditions caused by the impact of the Covered Cause of Loss in the area where the described premises are located.
- Loss of Business Income must be caused by direct physical loss or damage at the described premises caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.

## Interruption Of Computer Operations

1. **Coverage Extension**  
   Subject to all provisions of this Additional Coverage, you may extend the insurance that applies to Business Income and Extra Expense to apply to a "suspension" of "operations" caused by an interruption in computer operations due to destruction or corruption of "electronic data" due to a Covered Cause of Loss.

2. **Covered Causes of Loss**  
   With respect to the coverage provided under this Additional Coverage, the Covered Causes of Loss are subject to the following:

   - **Special Form**  
     If the Causes Of Loss - Special Form applies, coverage under this Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations is limited to the "specified causes of loss" as defined in that form, and Collapse as set forth in that form.

   - **Broad Form**  
     If the Causes Of Loss - Broad Form applies, coverage under this Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations includes Collapse as set forth in that form.

   - **Endorsed Causes**  
     If the Causes Of Loss Form is endorsed to add a Covered Cause of Loss, the additional Covered Cause of Loss does not apply to the coverage provided under this Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations.

   - **Computer Virus**  
     The Covered Causes of Loss include a computer virus, harmful code, or similar instruction introduced into or enacted on a computer system (including "electronic data") or a network to which it is connected, designed to damage or destroy any part of the system or disrupt its normal operation. However, there is no coverage for an interruption related to manipulation of a computer system (including "electronic data") by any employee, including a temporary or leased employee, or by an entity retained by you or for you to inspect, design, install, maintain, repair, or replace that system.

3. **Limit of Insurance**  
   The most we will pay under this Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations, for all loss sustained and expense incurred in any one policy year, regardless of the number of interruptions or the number of premises, locations, or computer systems involved is $10,000, unless a higher limit is shown in the Declarations, subject to the following:

   - **Active Virus Scanning**  
     If at the time of interruption, the computer system is equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, this entire amount is available.

   - **No Active Virus Scanning**  
     If at the time of interruption, the computer system is not equipped with active virus scanning or anti-virus software, payment will be limited to $2,500 for that occurrence.

   If loss payment relating to the first interruption does not exhaust this amount, then the balance is available for loss or expense sustained or incurred as a result of subsequent interruptions in that policy year. A balance remaining at the end of a policy year does not increase the amount of insurance in the next policy year. With respect to any interruption which begins in one policy year and continues or results in additional loss or expense in a subsequent policy year(s), all loss and expense is deemed to be sustained or incurred in the policy year in which the interruption began.

4. **Period of Restoration**  
   This Additional Coverage - Interruption Of Computer Operations does not apply to loss sustained or expense incurred after the end of the "period of restoration", even if the amount of insurance stated in (3) above has not been exhausted.

   - Similar use as the location described in the Declarations; or
   - Use as a warehouse.

2. The most we will pay under this extension for the sum of Business Income loss and Extra Expense incurred, is **$100,000** at each location.

## B. LOSS CONDITIONS

The following conditions apply in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Commercial Property Conditions.

### 1. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the amount of Net Income and operating expense or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the amount of Net Income and operating expense or amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:

- Pay its chosen appraiser; and
- Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

### 2. Duties In The Event Of Loss

You must see that the following are done in the event of loss:

1. Notify the police if a law may have been broken.
2. Give us prompt notice of the direct physical loss or damage. Include a description of the property involved.
3. As soon as possible, give us a description of how, when, and where the direct physical loss or damage occurred.
4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for any subsequent loss or damage resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasible, set the damaged property aside and in the best possible order for examination.
5. As often as may be reasonably required, permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records. Also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection, testing and analysis, and permit us to make copies from your books and records.
6. Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss containing the information we request to investigate the claim. You must do this within 60 days after our request. We will supply you with the necessary forms.
7. Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.
8. If you intend to continue your business, you must resume all or part of your "operations" as quickly as possible.

b. We may examine any insured under oath, while not in the presence of any other insured and at such times as may be reasonably required, about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim, including an insured's books and records. In the event of an examination, an insured's answers must be signed.

### 3. Loss Determination

The amount of Business Income loss will be determined based on:

1. The Net Income of the business before the direct physical loss or damage occurred;
2. The likely Net Income of the business if no physical loss or damage had occurred, but not including any Net Income that would likely have been earned as a result of an increase in the volume of business due to favorable business conditions caused by the impact of the

     We do pay the reasonable costs incurred by you for necessary repairs or emergency measures performed solely to protect covered property from further damage by a peril insured against if a peril insured against has already caused a loss to covered property.

3. **DAMAGED PROPERTY**

## Appraisal Process

If either party makes a written demand for appraisal, each will select a competent, independent appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser's identity within 20 days of receipt of the written demand. The two appraisers will then select a competent, impartial umpire. If the two appraisers are unable to agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we can ask a judge of a court of record in the state where the property is located to select an umpire.

The appraisers will then determine and state separately the amount of each loss. The appraisers will also determine the value of covered property items at the time of the loss, if requested. If the appraisers submit a written report of any agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If the appraisers fail to agree within a reasonable time, they will submit only their differences to the umpire. Written agreement so itemized and signed by any two of these three sets the amount of the loss.

Each appraiser will be paid by the party selecting that appraiser. Other expenses of the appraisal and the compensation of the umpire will be paid equally by you and us.

## Assignment

This provision applies only if the named insured is an individual.

### Your Death

On your death, we cover the following as an insured:

1. The person who has custody of your property until a legal representative is qualified and appointed; or
2. Your legal representative.

This person or organization is an insured only with respect to property covered by this coverage.

### Policy Term Is Not Extended

This coverage does not extend past the policy term shown in the Declarations.

## Concealment, Misrepresentation, or Fraud

This coverage is void as to you and any other insured if, before or after a loss:

- You or any other insured have willfully concealed or misrepresented:
  1. A material fact or circumstance that relates to this insurance or the subject thereof; or
  2. Your interest herein.
- There has been fraud or false swearing by you or any other insured with regard to a matter that relates to this insurance or the subject thereof.

## Cooperation

You must cooperate with us in performing all acts required by this policy.

## Deductible

We pay only that part of your loss over the deductible amount shown in the Declarations in any one occurrence.

## Insurable Interest

We do not cover more than your insurable interest in any property.

## Loss Clause

Except as shown under Limited Fungi Coverage, if provided, the amount of insurance under this policy will not be reduced except for total loss of a scheduled item. Any unearned premium that applies to such item will be refunded.

## No Benefit to Bailee

Insurance under this coverage will not directly or indirectly benefit anyone having custody of your property.

## Other Insurance

- **Proportional Share:** You may have another policy subject to the same terms as this policy. If you do, we will pay your share of the covered loss. Our share is the proportion that the applicable limit under this policy bears to the limit of all policies covering on the same basis.
- **Excess Amount:** If there is another policy covering the same loss, other than that described above, we pay only for the amount of covered loss in excess of the amount due from that other policy, whether you can collect on it or not. However, we do not pay more than the applicable limit.

## Our Payment of Loss

- **Adjustment and Payment of Loss:** We adjust all losses with you. Payment will be made to you unless another loss payee is named in the policy.
- **Conditions for Payment of Loss:** An insured loss will be payable 30 days after:
  1. A satisfactory proof of loss is received; and
  2. The amount of the loss has been established either by written agreement with you or the filing of an appraisal award with us.

## Our Right to Recover Payment

If we pay for a loss, we may require you to assign to us your right of recovery against others. You must do all that is necessary to secure our rights. We do not pay for a loss if you impair this right to recover. You may waive your right to recover from others in writing before a loss occurs.

## Pair or Set

The value of a lost or damaged article that is part of a pair or set is based on a reasonable proportion of the value of the entire pair or set. The loss is not considered a total loss of the pair or set.

## Parts

The value of a lost or damaged part of an item that consists of several parts when it is complete is based on the value of only the lost or damaged part or the cost to repair or replace it.

## Policy Term

We pay for a covered loss that occurs during the policy term.

## Recoveries

If we pay you for the loss and lost or damaged property is recovered, or payment is made by those responsible for the loss, the following provisions apply:

- You must notify us promptly if you recover property or receive payment;
- We must notify you promptly if we recover property or receive payment.

## ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS

### COINSURANCE CLAUSE (COVERAGE 1)

As shown in the Declarations. Actual cash value includes deduction for depreciation.

We will not pay for a greater proportion of any loss to property covered than the limit of insurance under this policy for such property bears to the amount produced by multiplying the actual cash value or replacement cost, as stated in the Declarations, of such property by the coinsurance percentage stated in the Declarations.

If the aggregate claim for any loss is both:

a. less than $10,000; and  
b. less than 5% of the limit of insurance for all insurance which applies to the damaged property at the time of loss;

no inventory or appraisal of the undamaged property shall be required. However, this does not waive the requirements of the first paragraph of this clause.

If the insurance under Coverage 1. is divided into separate limits of insurance, this condition shall apply separately to the property covered under each such limit of insurance.

#### Under Coverage 1.

When loss to covered property is settled at the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss, we shall pay no more than the lesser of the following:

a. the cost to repair or replace the damaged covered property with property of like kind and quality; or  
b. the limit of insurance shown in the Declarations for the covered property.

When loss to covered property is settled at replacement cost of the property at the time of loss, we shall pay no more than the lesser of the following:

a. the full cost to repair the covered property;  
b. the full cost to replace the covered property with property of like kind and quality even if the property has technological advantages, as long as such property is capable of performing the same function as the equipment being replaced; or  
c. the limit of insurance shown in the Declarations for the property covered.

#### Under Coverage 2.

We shall pay no more than the lesser of the following:

a. the actual cost to repair, replace or reproduce the media;  
b. if the media is not repaired, replaced or reproduced the value of blank media; or  
c. the limit of insurance shown in the Declarations for the property covered.

The limit of insurance shown in the Declarations for covered property is the total limit of our liability for loss or damage to all covered property in any one occurrence at one location. With respect to covered property you do not own, we will pay no more than the amount for which you are legally liable.

### REMOVAL

We will pay for property damaged while being removed or while removed from a premises because of danger from a peril we insure against. Coverage applies pro rata for five days at each place to which the property is removed.

### DEBRIS REMOVAL

We will pay reasonable expenses you incur to remove debris of covered property following a loss from a peril we insure against. The amount recovered under this insurance for both loss to property and debris removal shall not exceed the amount of insurance applying to the covered property.

The cost of removal of debris will not be considered in applying the Coinsurance Clause.

### LIMIT OF LIABILITY

Accidental direct physical loss of or damage to covered property shall be adjusted on the basis of:

   2. The interest of insured persons and all others in the property;  
   3. Actual cash value and amount of loss to the property;  
   4. All encumbrances on the property;  
   5. Other policies covering the loss; and  
   6. Changes in the title, use or possession of the property.

f. Submit to examinations under oath by any person we name and sign the transcript of the examinations.  
g. Produce for examination, with permission to copy, all books of account, bills, invoices, receipts and other vouchers as we may reasonably require.

### B. Appraisal

The section "APPRAISAL" is deleted and replaced by the following condition:

If you and we do not agree on the amount of the loss or the value of covered property, either party may demand that these amounts be determined by appraisal.

- If either makes a written demand for appraisal, each will select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser's identity within 20 days of receipt of the written demand.
- The two appraisers will then select a competent and disinterested umpire. If the two appraisers are unable to agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we can ask a judge of a court of record in the state where the property is located to select an umpire.
- The appraisers will then determine and state separately the amount of each loss. The appraisers will also determine the value of covered property items at the time of the loss, if requested.
- If the appraisers submit a written report of any agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If the appraisers fail to agree within a reasonable time, they will submit only their differences to the umpire.
- Written agreement so itemized and signed by any two of these three, sets the amount of the loss. Interest on the award will be calculated from the time the appraisal award becomes payable, as stated in OUR PAYMENT OF LOSS condition.
- Each appraiser will be paid by the party selecting that appraiser. Other expenses of the appraisal and the compensation of the umpire will be paid equally by you and us.

### C. Our Payment of Loss

The section "OUR PAYMENT OF LOSS" is deleted and replaced by the following condition:

We will pay you or make good any loss covered by this policy, unless another payee is named in the policy. We will pay within five (5) days after:

a. We receive your proof of loss; and  
b. The amount of loss is finally determined by an agreement between you and us, a court judgment or an appraisal award.

We will not pay or make good any loss which you have collected from others.

# CAP ON LOSSES FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM  
AND

It is agreed:

1. With respect to any one or more certified acts of terrorism, we will not pay any amounts for which we are not responsible because of the application of any provision which results in a cap on our liability for payments for terrorism losses in accordance with the terms of the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act).

   a. if the aggregate covered commercial property and casualty insurance losses resulting from the terrorist act exceed $5 million; and
   b. (1) if the act of terrorism is:
      - a violent act; or

# Important Information Regarding Terrorism Risk Insurance Coverage

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was signed into law on November 26, 2002. The Act (including ensuing Congressional actions pursuant to the Act) defines an act of terrorism, to mean any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States to be:

1. **An act of terrorism;**
2. **A violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure;**
3. **To have resulted in damage within the United States or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission;**
4. **To have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States government by coercion.**

Subject to the policy terms and conditions, this policy provides insurance coverage for acts of terrorism as defined in the Act.

Any coverage for certain commercial lines of property and casualty insurance provided by your policy for losses caused by certified acts of terrorism are partially paid by the federal government under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula, the government will reimburse us for 85% of such covered losses that exceed the statutory deductible paid by us. However, beginning January 1, 2016, the share will decrease 1% per calendar year until it equals 80%.

You should also know that in the event aggregate insured losses exceed $100 billion during any year the Act is in effect, then the federal government and participating United States insurers that have met their insurer deductible shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of that amount of the loss that exceeds $100 billion. In the event that aggregate insured losses exceed $100 billion annually, no additional claims will be paid by the federal government or insurers. This formula is currently effective through December 31, 2020 unless extended.

The premium charge, if any, for this coverage is shown separately on the attached Declarations page. In the event of a certified act of terrorism, future policies also may include a government assessed terrorism loss risk-spreading premium in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

Please contact us if you would like to reject coverage for certified acts of terrorism.
