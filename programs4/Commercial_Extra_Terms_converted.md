### POLICYHOLDER DISCLOSURE

#### NOTICE OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE

You are hereby notified that under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended, you have a right to purchase insurance coverage for losses resulting from acts of terrorism. As defined in Section 102(1) of the Act: The term “act of terrorism” means any act or acts that are certified by the Secretary of the Treasury—in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General of the United States—to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.

**YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WHERE COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BY THIS POLICY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM, SUCH LOSSES MAY BE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT UNDER A FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL LAW. HOWEVER, YOUR POLICY MAY CONTAIN OTHER EXCLUSIONS WHICH MIGHT AFFECT YOUR COVERAGE, SUCH AS AN EXCLUSION FOR NUCLEAR EVENTS. UNDER THE FORMULA, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT GENERALLY REIMBURSES 85% THROUGH 2015; 84% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2016; 83% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2017; 82% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2018; 81% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2019 and 80% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2020, OF COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES EXCEEDING THE STATUTORILY ESTABLISHED DEDUCTIBLE PAID BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY PROVIDING THE COVERAGE. THE PREMIUM CHARGED FOR THIS COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BELOW AND DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY CHARGES FOR THE PORTION OF LOSS THAT MAY BE COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ACT.**

**YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT, AS AMENDED, CONTAINS A $100 BILLION CAP THAT LIMITS U.S. GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS INSURERS’ LIABILITY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH LOSSES IN ANY ONE CALENDAR YEAR EXCEEDS $100 BILLION. IF THE AGGREGATE INSURED LOSSES FOR ALL INSURERS EXCEED $100 BILLION, YOUR COVERAGE MAY BE REDUCED.**

In this state, a terrorism exclusion makes an exception for (and thereby provides coverage for) fire losses resulting from an act of terrorism. Therefore, if you reject this offer of terrorism coverage, that rejection does not apply to fire losses resulting from an act of terrorism. Coverage for such fire losses will be provided in your policy. The additional premium just for such fire coverage is stated below. If you reject the offer described above for terrorism coverage, this premium is due.

### Acceptance or Rejection of Terrorism Insurance Coverage

- I hereby elect to purchase terrorism coverage for a prospective premium of **$12,424.00**.
- I hereby decline to purchase terrorism coverage for certified acts of terrorism. I understand that an exclusion of certain terrorism losses will be made part of the policy.

If you decline this offer, the premium for terrorism (fire only) coverage is **Refer to Underwriter**.
